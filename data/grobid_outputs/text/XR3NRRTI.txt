••
Village-level savings groups • Training • Lump-sum transfers (poultry or cash) • Nutrition behavioral change counseling: basic and enhanced models • Male engagement groups • Interpersonal therapy • All are targeted to PSNP households only • Due to scale and resource constraints: transfers and interpersonal therapy are also further targeted within PSNP beneficiaries Light-touch and more intensive models • In each domain, these elements were bundled into both a lighter touch and a more intensive set of interventions evaluated in the experimental design. • Livelihoods • L: Savings groups and training only • L*: Savings groups, training, and transfers ($375 PPP) • Transfer modality randomly assigned as cash or poultry at the cluster level • Extremely poor only (poorest 55%) eligible for transfers; less poor eligible for L only • Nutrition and health • N: Basic behavioral change counseling (BCC) only • N*: Enhanced BCC, male engagement, and group therapy • Only women experiencing depression were eligible for therapy; those not eligible receive enhanced BCC + male engagement only Data collection: baseline (2018) and two follow-up surveys, midline (2019) and endline (2021).
• SPIR delivered the PSNP transfers in collaboration with local governments.
• SPIR also rolled out a graduation model centering around six interventions in domains of livelihoods, health, and nutrition • Sample: 3,314 households in 192 kebeles (subdistricts) in Oromia and Amhara
• Inclusion criteria: PSNP beneficiary households with a child 0-36 months in which the primary caretaker was also resident in the household.
• Attrition: 3% at midline, 7% at endline (primarily inaccessibility due to conflict).
Nutrition (N): Basic nutrition behavior change communication (BCC) Enhanced Nutrition (N*): Intensive nutrition counseling Enhanced livelihoods (L*): Poultry / cash transfers Enhanced nutrition (N*): Male engagement groups Group therapy (IPT-G) Timeline Baseline Feb to April 2018 Midline July to Oct 2019 Endline Feb to April 2021
• Drawing on this design, we will present the effects of SPIR on four main families of outcomes.
• Livelihoods
• Gender
• Mental health
• Each analysis generally reports outcomes at both midline and endline.
• Again, two of the interventions were targeted to subsamples.
• Lump-sum transfers: targeted to extremely poor (poorest 55% using baseline assets)
• Therapy: targeted to women experiencing depression (assessed at midline)
• Both eligible subsamples identified consistently across all sample communities.
• Accordingly, in cases where we seek to precisely estimate effects of transfers, separate specifications are estimated for extremely poor (who were eligible for transfers in L* treatment arms) vis-à-vis less poor (ineligible for transfers in all arms).
• For mental health outcomes, treatment effects will be presented only for women experiencing depression (and eligible for therapy in N*).

• Sample households are all rural subsistence producers; more than 75% of household heads have no education, and around 20% are female-headed.
• Consumption per capita is around $1.30 a day at baseline.
• In the study period, households are exposed to a wide range of shocks.
• Around a third of households experience a (mild to moderate) drought.
• Infestations of desert locusts affect one in three households in Oromia.
• Sporadic violence in parts of Amhara and Oromia; our trial ends three months following the start of the Tigray war.
• Previous papers have shown substantial effects of graduation model interventions on enhancing livelihoods and reducing poverty.
• This model includes a smaller transfer (valued at $375 PPP) and leaner support services.
• More limited training • No household-level coaching • No experimental variation in consumption support
• Can the same positive effects on livelihoods be replicated?
Returning to the experimental design
• We report effects for the extremely poor and less poor samples separately given that only extremely poor are eligible for transfers.
• The analysis focuses on five primary outcome families: assets, financial inclusion, agricultural and livestock income, non-agricultural income, and consumption and food security.
• For concision, this presentation only shows endline findings.
T3: L + N* T2: L* + N C: PSNP only T1: L* + N* Returning to the SPIR trial design: Extremely poor only Full sample: 192 kebeles / 3,314 households Poultry Cash Poultry Cash 230 HH 236 HH 250 HH 241 HH 488 HH 462 HH • Full heterogeneity across each trial arm in assignment to transfer modality (or no transfer in T3) • Cross-cutting heterogeneity in nutrition exposure Extremely poor Extremely poor Extremely poor Extremely poor T2: L + N C: PSNP only T1, T3: L + N* Less poor Returning to the SPIR trial design: less poor Full sample: 192 kebeles / 3,314 households Less poor Less poor Less poor 346 HH 367 HH 365 HH 329 HH • No heterogeneity in livelihoods programming for less poor • Savings groups + training only, in all 3 treatment arms
• Only variation is N versus N*
• The positive effects are generally restricted to transfer recipients.
• There are some weak positive effects on assets (.1 standard deviations relative to the control arm).
• Large positive effects on financial inclusion.
• Some positive effects on agricultural income, but no significant effect on consumption.
• There are no significant effects for the less poor, other than the positive effect on financial inclusion.
• In the absence of transfers, there are no meaningful effects on livelihoods-related measures.
Heterogeneous effects with respect to drought exposure
• We also assess whether the intervention was effective in building resilience to weather shocks by analyzing heterogeneous effects with respect to drought exposure.
• We identify droughts using the SPEI drought measure, exploiting variation across both survey rounds and across localities in exposure to drought.
• For concision, we focus on livestock holdings (the largest component of assets) and the food gap (a measure of food security).
• We also simplify further to a single pooled treatment effect (SPIR versus control).

• PSNP4 (2015) was the first phase of the program to include a specific nutrition program. However, to date neither the earlier phase nor PSNP4 have generated evidence around reduced stunting.
• Few studies of graduation programs include nutritional status or diet diversity as primary outcomes.
• SPIR included a core set of nutritional services (N) as well as an enhanced package (N*) with stunting as a primary outcome.
• The trial varied these core and enhanced services along with livelihood grants to assess potential complementarities.
• All PSNP clients were eligible to attend six 2-hour nutrition behavioral change communication (BCC) sessions in lieu of public works.
• In SPIR, all communities had water and sanitation programs. Also,
• T2 (L*+N) included lump-sum transfers (poultry or cash) plus the core nutrition intervention, BCC discussions in village-level savings groups.
• T1 (L*+N*): included lump-sum transfers (poultry or cash) plus the enhanced nutrition programming provided by government health extension workers. This envisioned 11 home visits over the first 1,000 days from conception. Also, women with an acutely malnourished child were invited to participate in two-week intensive child feeding sessions.
• T3 (L+N*): excluded lump-sum transfers but included enhanced nutrition.
• Results presented only for the extremely poor sample.
Impact on stunting, extremely poor Cash complemented intensive nutrition services
• Neither enhanced nutrition services alone nor core nutrition with lumpsum transfers improved stunting.
• Stunting improved under enhanced nutrition with the cash transfer, but not with the poultry transfer.
• Conversely, neither cash nor poultry were complementary to the overall significant improvements in access to health care services in the enhanced nutrition arm • This was driven by both a 14 percentage point increase in contact with health workers compared to the control and an over 30 PP increase in nutrition training in village-level savings groups and 15 PP increase in attendance in community sanitation events.
• The core nutrition arm also had significant increase in participation in nutrition training through savings groups but no increase in contact with health workers or sanitation.
Impact on access to healthcare Summing up
• The enhanced nutrition program also had a modest but significant impact on maternal diet diversity. In conjunction with poultry grants it also had a significant impact on child diet diversity through increased egg consumption.
• The various impacts on nutrition services and intermediate outcomes, however, do not explain the relatively large complementarity of cash and enhanced nutrition on the primary stunting outcome.
• Overall, there seems to be a protective role of cash in a time of worsening anthropometrics but appreciable gaps in service delivery and diet diversity remain.
• There are growing improvements in gender equity worldwide, with increased girl's school enrollment and women's labor force participation, but an area where gender inequality broadly persists is in the home.
• Even when husband and wife work outside the home, women still perform a larger share of domestic tasks, and social norms about gender roles play a major role in explaining these imbalances.
• Only recently has the importance of addressing gender norms been acknowledged in poverty alleviation programs, but very few programs have targeted gender norms as an explicit outcome.
• 6 sessions lasting about an hour on 1) workloads of men and women ("Daily clock");
2) cooperation and sharing household work;
3) household decision making; 4) improved listening, communication and understanding skills; 5) engaging men in childcare work; and 6) identifying restrictive social norms related to women's mobility.
• Sessions including about 20-25 men and women meet approximately every two weeks and were facilitated by community facilitators.
• 8 sessions lasting about 2 hours each on
• Gender roles • Power and early marriage • Father's legacy • Caregiving • Division of caregiving • Understanding nutrition
• Approximately 16 men in each group, including both PSNP and non-PSNP households in an effort to achieve a community-level 'tipping point' in shifting attitudes and norms.
• Groups met twice per month, facilitated by trained male facilitators and advocators
• At midline, all treatment arms improved men's gender equitable behaviors and attitudes, but impacts were only sustained or improved at endline for the treatment arms with N*.
• The main difference in the N* component between midline and endline was the male engagement groups which were rolled out after the midline survey.
• A multi-faceted graduation model with gender components can improve men's gender equitable attitudes and behaviors.
• However, without reinforcing interventions directly targeting men's attitudes and behaviors, these improvements are unlikely to persist.

Table 10 . Treatment Effects on Housing
Randomization was stratified by village. Column 4 shows p-values based on regressions of each baseline variable on the treatment indicator and a full set of village indicators. The joint test for orthogonality is based on regression of the treatment indicator on all baseline variables and village indicators. Variables are top winsorized at the 99th percentile.
Variables are top winsorized at the 99th percentile. * denotes statistical significance at the 10-percent level; ** at the 5-percent level; and *** at the 1-percent level.Repeats analysis from Table2with bounds.

Village fixed effects included in all columns. Robust standard errors in parentheses. Dummy variables are included as controls and in set of interactions if a covariate is missing (coefficients not shown). Regressors are demeaned and the coefficient on "Treatment" in the interacted specification shows the average effect of treatment, as it does in the non-interacted specification.

Notes: The main assets that were given out as part of the program were livestock (75%). The second most common asset was start-up capital or assets for small businesses but the endline survey did not include information about enterprise assets. Thus, the two asset categories "household durables" and "Ag. tools & structures" mostly closely map into "asset types not part of the program". For simplicity of presentation we include five items as part of household durables that could not readily be classified as a household durable or productive asset. The mean of these "other" items is PPP$87.76 and the results are qualitatively unchanged when classifying them as part of a separate category. Variables are top winsorized at the 99th percentile. * denotes statistical significance at the 10-percent level; ** at the 5percent level; and *** at the 1-percent level.

Notes: The dependent variable of row 1, "Food security index", is a normalized average of the normalized transformations of rows 2-6, with normalization referring to substracting the control group mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the control group. Dependent variables in rows 2-6 are binary indicators. The dep. var. of row 2, "All household members usually get enough food", is based on the question "How often do all members of your household not get enough food to eat?" and is coded as 1 if the response was not one of the prompted options that ranged from "Daily" to "Yearly", and 0 otherwise. The dep. var. of row 3, "Everyone regularly eats 2+ meals a day", is based on the question "Does everyone in the household regularly eat at least two meals a day? " and is coded as 1 if the response to the latter question was "Yes", and 0 otherwise. The dep. var. of row 4, "Adults did not cut or skip meals in past 12m", is based on the question "In the last 12 months, did you or any other adults in your household ever cut the size of your meals or skip meals because there were not enough resources for food?" and is coded as 1 if the response to the latter question was "No", and 0 otherwise. The dep. var. of row 5, "Adults did not skip eating for a full days in past 12m", is based on the question "In the last 12 months, did you or any other adults in your household ever not eat for a whole day because there wasn't enough money for food?" and is coded as 1 if the response to the latter question was "No", and 0 otherwise. The dep. var. of row 6, "Kids did not skip eating for a full days in past 12m", is based on the question "In the last 12 months, did a household member younger than 18 ever cut the size of the meals or ever skip a meal because there wasn't enough money for food?" and is coded as 1 if the response to the latter question was "No", and 0 otherwise. Variables are top winsorized at the 99th percentile. * denotes statistical significance at the 10-percent level; ** at the 5-percent level; and *** at the 1-percent level.
Appendix Notes: "Hh" = household. This table repeats the analysis of Table 3 with inverse probability weighted observations, with weights based the likelihood of being surveyed at endline by recertification status as well as the predicted likelihood of being surveyed using the baseline variables of Tables 1, 2 and 3. See Table 2 for additional details. * denotes statistical significance at the 10-percent level; ** at the 5percent level; and *** at the 1-percent level. For additional notes, see Table 3 .

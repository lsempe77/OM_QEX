• In the report, we present the effect of SPIR programming on three samples of interest:
-The full sample of all households, analyzing the effects of T1, T2, and T3 relative to the control arm. -The poor only sample of households, analyzing the effects of poultry and cash transfers (in conjunction with aspirations) as well as T3 relative to the control arm. -The sample of non poor households (not eligible for cash and poultry), analyzing the effects of T1 and T2 (in conjunction with aspirations) as well as T3 relative to the control arm.
• For poor, households, the poultry transfer had a substantial positive effect on increasing household ownership of and income from poultry.
• Comparable investments by households who received the one-time cash transfer are smaller; the increase in the probability of owning poultry is 39 percentage points for poultry, compared to 9 percentage points for cash.
• Poultry households also show differentially larger investment in other forms of livestock vis-à-vis cash recipient households.
• Non-poor households exposed to base L* programming also increase their engagement in poultry production, showing an increase in the probability of owning poultry of between 8 and 10 percentage points.
• There is no effect for households exposed only to L programming only.
Summing up
• For savings and credit, the effects are consistent across all three treatment arms.
• There is a dramatic increase in the probability that women report any savings (between 36 and 49 percentage points), driven primarily by women reporting savings in VESAs; this pattern is observed for both poor and non-poor women.
• By contrast, there is little evidence of any shift in credit access.
• The substantial effect on female savings is consistent with the observed pattern of consistently high participation in VESA groups.
Expenditure on crop inputs: Full sample Summing up
• In general, there is little evidence of any effect on labor outside the household, or household investment in cropping.
• For poor households, there are some moderate effects on outside labor for certain subtreatment arms, but this evidence is not consistent and should be interpreted tentatively.
• Unfortunately, the midline survey did not collect data on household engagement in non-agricultural businesses; this will be explored further at endline.
Summing up
• In general, there is little evidence of any of the interventions (including the cross-randomized aspirations video treatment) on reported aspirations of male or female respondents for their children's education.
• Households in T1 only do show some evidence of an increase in aspired income, but this does not seem to reflect the effects of the targeted cross-randomized aspirations intervention.
• The aspirations intervention was also characterized by relatively low participation (less than 50%) in the data reported by households, though this pattern will be explored further in administrative data.
• There is evidence of substantial positive effects of both the poultry and the cash transfers randomized to poor households, though the effects of the poultry transfer seem to be significantly larger for the variables measured.
• There is also evidence of positive effects of L* programming for non-poor households, particularly for livestock production and female savings.
• The effects of L programming are smaller and often not statistically significant.
• There is little evidence of any effect of the cross-randomized aspirations treatment, and little evidence of experimental effects on aspirations overall.
The N* interventions-and to a lesser degree the N interventionshave shown success in increasing exposure to health services including BCC, food demonstrations, and WASH. Similarly, communication measures increased significantly; over half of caregivers for the children found to be underweight participated in camps aimed at addressing malnutrition. These increases reflect the goals of the SPIR design. Nevertheless, the frequency of contacts between households and service providers is less than planned and may indicate start-up processes at the time of the midline. This then provides a basis to expect continued improvements over the SPIR program.
• Objective is to report the effects of SPIR programming on gender norms, women's decision-making, depression, and intimate partner violence (IPV)
• Conceptual framework -L and N activities: bring women and men together to provide them with knowledge and training over a wide range of topics, thereby improving social capital and catalyzing women's empowerment. -L* and N*: address constraints on women's role in intrahousehold decision-making, mobility, choice of livelihood activities, and access to markets that derive from cultural and social norms (through SAA); target women for the poultry and cash transfers; include men in the nutrition BCC; and provide IPT-G for women and men screened for depression. -At the time of the midline survey, however, neither the male engagement groups nor IPT-G groups had begun.
• In the report, we present the effect of SPIR programming on three samples of interest:
-The full sample of all households, analyzing the effects of T1 (L*+N*), T2 (L*+N), and T3 (L+N*) relative to the control arm. -The poor only sample of households, analyzing the effects of poultry and cash transfers (in conjunction with aspirations) as well as T3 relative to the control arm. -The sample of non poor households (not eligible for cash and poultry), analyzing the effects of T1 and T2 (in conjunction with aspirations) as well as T3 relative to the control arm.
• For this presentation we focus on the full sample results only Gender norms
• Gender equitable indicators binary indicator that equals one if the respondent says a husband is not justified in beating his wife under any of the four circumstances (primary male and female). -binary indicator that equals one if the respondent says it is acceptable for a woman to travel alone to each of the three specified places (primary male and female). -binary indicator if respondent's gender equitable norms score is above the median (list of 10 gender norms questions, primary male only)
• T1 marginally increases the probability that a man is above the median on the gender equitable scale by 6 pp • T2 increases the probability that men report that it is never justified for husbands to beat their wives and that it is acceptable for women to travel alone by 6 pp
• Decision-making with respect to input into productive decisions on horticulture, large livestock, small livestock, and poultry for all animal categories, the question was about both raising and processing of meat/milk/eggs.
• Two types of productive decisions for each activity:
the quantity of inputs that should be used the quantity of the output that should be sold or consumed at home.
• We create binary indicators that equal one if a woman reports having input into most or all decisions for each activity and decision type
Decision-making
• T2 marginally increases the probability that a woman reports contributing to most decisions related to input use for small livestock by 6.4 pp and sale or consumption of the output from large livestock by 7.6pp • Internationally validated standardized IPV measures from the WHO Violence Against Women Instrument -Instrument asks a woman if she has ever experienced the act of violence and if she had experienced it in the last 13 months. -For each type of violence, multiple behaviorally specific questions were administered in order to reduce underreporting • Create 4 indicators for marital control, emotional violence, physical violence and sexual violence in the last 13 months IPV • No impacts of any treatment arm Summing up • T1 and T2 improves men's but not women's gender equitable attitudes/norms (not significantly different from T3) • T2 improves women's decision-making around small and large livestock but not horticulture or poultry (significantly different from T1 and T3) • T2 and T3 decrease the probability that a women has a PHQ-9 of 8 or higher, but no impacts on PHQ-9 scores of 10 or higher and no impacts on men's depression (not significantly different from T1)
impacts are concentrated among women with relatively low levels of depressive symptoms
• No impacts on IPV of any treatment arm for the full sample Conclusion
• Caveats:
-Many impacts are marginally significant (significant at the 10 percent level) -Testing many indicators which leads to issues of multiple hypothesis testing
• But, the handful of positive impacts across T1, T2, and T3 are promising given that not all activities had been rolled out by midline and some outcomes might take more time to change, such as personal norms regarding gender

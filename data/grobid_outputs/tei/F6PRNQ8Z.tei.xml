<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_zmhDFbk"><p xml:id="_5FD3MDj">Poverty is a complex problem that affects millions of people worldwide. Despite the various measures taken, there is still a long way to go in eradicating poverty and improving the standard of living for all. This study evaluates the impact of an integrated approach, designed to address specific constraints faced by poor households, on poverty reduction and socio-economic development. The study employed a Randomized Controlled Trials design to evaluate the impact of the intervention. For the analysis, 100 households in the treatment group received the program, while the control group had an equal number of households that did not receive any assistance during the entire research period. Additionally, the study investigated 400 individuals to assess the individual-level outcomes. The findings suggested that the intervention had a positive impact on all economic and financial outcome variables of the treatment group. The study also reported an improvement in the personal lives of the participants by improving physical and mental health. Moreover, the results suggested that the intervention has contributed to increased political involvement and women's empowerment. In light of these findings, the study recommends an integrated approach that combines various poverty reduction measures to enhance the well-being of impoverished households.</p></div>

Approximately 8.5% of the global population, equivalent to roughly 659 million people is in a state of extreme poverty, wherein their income falls below the threshold of $2.15 per day, making it insufficient to satisfy their basic needs <ref type="bibr">(World Bank, 2023)</ref>. Research has shown that poverty can have significant and long-lasting effects on individuals, families, and communities. Poverty is strongly associated with poor health outcomes and can lead to chronic health problems such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness, and mental health disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Adler &amp; Stewart, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">WHO, 2021)</ref>. In addition, poverty limits access to education, and women and girls are disproportionately affected by poverty (UN Women, 2021; UNESCO, 2020). Furthermore, poverty can contribute to environmental degradation, as people living in poverty may have to rely on unsustainable practices such as deforestation, overfishing, and exploitation of natural resources <ref type="bibr">(UNEP, 2021)</ref>. In addition to the above-mentioned implications, poverty can also contribute to increased crime rates and social unrest <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Baron &amp; Hartnagel, 2018)</ref>. In conclusion, poverty has numerous negative implications on individuals, families, and communities, including poor health outcomes, limited access to education and necessities, increased vulnerability to violence and exploitation, and perpetuation of social inequality.</p><p xml:id="_by8gsWQ">The situation of poverty in Pakistan is alarming and requires urgent attention. The poverty headcount for 2023 is projected to be 39.4%, indicating an increase compared to 34.2% in 2022, approximately 12.5 million more Pakistanis are expected to fall below the poverty threshold of a Lower-Middle Income Country, set at Poverty reduction strategies; rural development; randomized controlled trials; graduation program; impact evaluation US$3.65 per day (2017 PPP per capita) <ref type="bibr">(World Bank, 2023)</ref>. Moreover, in 2023, Pakistan experienced a significant economic slowdown, marked by an estimated 0.6% contraction in real GDP <ref type="bibr">(World Bank, 2023)</ref>. Moreover, the pandemic and political instability have exacerbated existing inequalities in Pakistan and led to a significant decline in the incomes of daily wage workers, and women due to their low participation in the labor force, and has increased the risk of child labor <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abbas et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abedullah et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Awan et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_ZHm7eTq">The government of Pakistan has implemented a range of measures, such as social safety net programs, poverty reduction initiatives, and economic reforms, to address the issue of poverty in the country. Despite the various measures taken by the government to tackle poverty, there is still a long way to go in eradicating poverty and improving the standard of living for all. The continued existence of poverty in Pakistan can be attributed to a range of factors, including economic instability, political instability, inadequate social safety nets, and lack of access to education and healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ali et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Butt &amp; Choudhry, 2020)</ref>. As poverty proves to be a complex and multifaceted issue, addressing it requires comprehensive and multi-dimensional solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Banerjee et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Barrientos et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Duflo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gelli et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Grosse &amp; Klasen, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Haushofer &amp; Shapiro, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kabeer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Singh et al., 2018)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_tKzV4r4">Literature Review</head><p xml:id="_eDDMZdq">The literature review investigates into the theoretical underpinnings and empirical evidence surrounding poverty reduction interventions, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of their conceptual frameworks and practical applications. It encompasses diverse perspectives such as the capability approach, human development approach, and social exclusion approach, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Laderchi et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_v6ujFxw">The capability approach, pioneered by Amartya Sen, emphasizes individuals' freedom to lead lives they value, highlighting the importance of expanding opportunities and enhancing capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sen, 1992)</ref>. This approach underscores the need to go beyond mere income measures and address the broader dimensions of poverty, including education, health, and social participation. Moreover, Sen's concept of "capability deprivation" underscores the importance of assessing poverty in terms of individuals' capabilities and functions rather than solely focusing on material deprivation. Poverty, as defined by the World Bank, entails pronounced deprivation of wellbeing, encompassing material deprivation, social exclusion, and limited opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sen, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Alkire &amp; Santos, 2014)</ref>. Poverty reduction interventions seek to address these complex dimensions to enhance the well-being of individuals and communities.</p><p xml:id="_JcZjusP">Cash transfers, whether unconditional or conditional, are key strategies in poverty alleviation, offering direct financial aid to enhance well-being and promote social inclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hanlon et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fiszbein &amp; Schady, 2009)</ref>. However, their effectiveness hinges on factors like program design, coverage, and economic context <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Otero &amp; Rhyne, 2016)</ref>. The design must ensure adequate support levels, frequency, and duration, while targeting mechanisms and economic conditions influence their reach and impact. Integrating cash transfers with complementary services can enhance their effectiveness in reducing poverty and promoting sustainable outcomes.</p><p xml:id="_M6d7Wyg">Microcredit programs, despite facing criticisms regarding scalability and sustainability, remain a popular poverty reduction intervention, particularly for empowering individuals, especially women, through small loans that foster economic activity and asset-building <ref type="bibr">(Yunus, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pitt &amp; Khandker, 1998)</ref>. These programs not only provide access to capital for entrepreneurship but also often incorporate training and support services, fostering financial literacy and business skills development <ref type="bibr">(Robinson, 2001)</ref>. Despite challenges, microcredit initiatives have demonstrated success in promoting self-employment, income generation, and community development in various contexts worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Armendariz &amp; Morduch, 2010)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_2JeM6jp">Education emerges as a critical pillar in poverty reduction efforts, as it empowers individuals and promotes social inclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Birdsall &amp; Londono, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Psacharopoulos &amp; Patrinos, 2018)</ref>. However, challenges persist in ensuring access to quality education, particularly for vulnerable populations (UNESCO, 2020). Vocational training programs contribute significantly to poverty reduction by enhancing employability and income-earning potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Blattman et al., 2014)</ref>. Effective implementation necessitates considerations of local labor market dynamics <ref type="bibr">(World Bank, 2021)</ref>. Access to healthcare services and health interventions plays a pivotal role in poverty reduction by improving well-being and productivity <ref type="bibr">(WHO, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Patel et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_BYvGn62">Transitioning to the empirical review, the historical evolution of randomized control trials (RCTs) is traced back to Hahnemann's study on homeopathic medicine in 1835, with broader adoption occurring in the 1920s across various fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1963)</ref>. Interest in RCTs surged from the 1950s to the 1970s, particularly in economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Banerjee &amp; Duflo, 2010)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_RSq5a5p">The empirical review analyzes impact evaluation studies, particularly through RCTs, focusing on poverty reduction interventions in developing countries such as income generation programs, microfinance, conditional cash transfers, and health insurance programs. Studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Duflo (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Haushofer and</ref>  <ref type="formula">Shapiro (2016</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gelli et al. (2013)</ref> synthesized evidence on the effectiveness of conditional cash transfer programs in improving child health outcomes across low-and middle-income countries. These programs, by incentivizing behaviors such as regular health checkups and school attendance, have been shown to contribute to reductions in child mortality rates and improvements in nutritional status. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Singh et al. (2018)</ref> provided compelling evidence on the empowering effects of livelihood interventions, particularly for women in contexts such as Afghanistan. By providing training, access to resources, and support for incomegenerating activities, these interventions not only enhance household economic stability but also promote gender equality and women's empowerment, thereby contributing to poverty reduction efforts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Araujo et al. (2017)</ref> conducted a study on the cognitive achievements of children benefiting from cash transfer programs in Ecuador, highlighting the broader impacts of such interventions beyond immediate economic outcomes. By alleviating financial constraints and enabling families to invest in children's education and well-being, cash transfers can have long-term positive effects on human capital development and intergenerational poverty transmission. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Alderman et al. (2006)</ref> reviewed the influence of health and nutrition interventions on education outcomes, emphasizing the interconnectedness of health and education in poverty reduction efforts. Access to healthcare services, nutritional supplementation, and hygiene interventions not only improve children's health but also enhance their school attendance, cognitive development, and academic performance, thus breaking the cycle of poverty through education. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Annear et al. (2017)</ref> shed light on the benefits of community-based health insurance schemes in countries like Laos, where access to affordable healthcare services is limited. By pooling risks and resources at the community level, these schemes improve financial protection against health-related expenses and increase access to essential healthcare services, particularly for marginalized populations.</p><p xml:id="_9EjgVmY">Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hanks et al. (2017)</ref> advocated for integrating behavioral economics principles into nutrition education interventions to promote healthier dietary behaviors and reduce the burden of malnutrition. By understanding the psychological and social factors influencing food choices, interventions can be designed to nudge individuals toward healthier behaviors, thus contributing to improved nutrition outcomes and overall well-being.</p><p xml:id="_Ns7tBmm">In conclusion, while these studies underscore the effectiveness of various poverty alleviation strategies, they also emphasize the importance of contextspecific interventions tailored to address diverse challenges. By combining theoretical insights with empirical evidence, this literature review offers a comprehensive understanding of poverty reduction interventions and their implications for enhancing the well-being of individuals and communities.</p></div>

The study area was selected using the Convenience Sampling Method-Convenience Sampling is when researchers leverage individuals that can be identified and approached with as little effort as possible. These are often individuals who are geographically close to the researchers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_gGSRmqU">Recruitment</head><p xml:id="_y8w2m5z">The target population for the study is the poorest of the poor households in the study area, with an able-bodied woman who could learn skills and later use her skills to earn a livelihood. They were selected using the Purposive Sampling Method-Purposive Sampling refers to a deliberate approach researchers employ in selecting a sample population, even if it may not be statistically representative of the larger target population. As the name implies, researchers purposefully choose to focus on a specific community or group of individuals who align with the desired characteristics or attributes necessary to achieve their research objectives.</p><p xml:id="_vTcuDU9">For this purpose, our research team held meetings with notables in the village. With the help of this Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), we identified more than five hundred households which were too high for our intervention and the available budget particularly. Then, with the help of a social committee working in the village, we collected data of households that were receiving Zakat-payment made annually under Islamic law on certain kinds of property and used for charitable purposes-from that local committee. The list included 320 poor households while we could select only 200 poorest of the poor households for our intervention because of limitation of financial resources. However, a sample of 200 is large enough for impact evaluation using a randomized controlled trial in social sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Zhong, 2009)</ref>. It was difficult to identify the poorest 200 households through large surveys as it takes time and costs. Hence, the indirect approach to identify the poorest of the poor households via the Simple Poverty Scorecard <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Schreiner, 2009)</ref> was used. The Simple Poverty Scorecard is based on the 2005/06 PSLM Survey conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics and uses 10 verifiable indicators to get a score that is highly correlated with poverty status. All points in the scorecard are non-negative integers, and total scores range from 0 (most likely below a poverty line) to 100 (least likely below a poverty line) (Appendix A). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the distribution of population across poverty scores. The horizontal axis shows poverty scores, vertical axis represents the percentage and frequency of the population. Our required sample of 200 touches the maximum poverty score of 42.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows that the average amount of money spent on consumption per person in the population every month is PKR 6,104. It also illustrates that the proportion of households in the population who live on less than $1.25 per day is 84%.</p><p xml:id="_27CnXmv">In contrast, if we follow the consumption measure which excludes medical expenditures and durable goods purchases, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> shows that each person in the population spends PKR 5,648 per month on consumption and 87% of households in the population live on less than $1.25 per day. It shows that we have chosen a sample of the poorest of the poor households from Sargodha.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_4zxZUuQ">Intervention Design</head><p xml:id="_YfXeguj">The study employed the Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) method for the impact evaluation. RCTs are experimental research designs widely used in scientific studies to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions or treatments. The key characteristic of RCTs is the random assignment of participants into different groups, including a treatment group that receives the intervention and a control group that does not. This randomization helps ensure that any observed differences between the groups can be attributed to the intervention rather than preexisting characteristics of the participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_dSyq9BJ">Mathematical Model for Randomized Controlled Trials</head><p xml:id="_K3ndpmv">Let's denote the treatment group as T and the control group as C.

This ensures that both groups are comparable at the start of the study, as any differences between the groups are due to chance rather than systematic bias. To ensure a balanced distribution of households between the treatment and control groups, we divided the 200 households into two equal groups, with 100 households in each group. We used an allocation ratio of 1:1, which is considered the best approach for randomized controlled trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Friedberg et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Piaggio et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scott et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

Achieving a balance between the treatment and control groups is essential in RCTs as it reduces the risk of bias and increases the validity and reliability of the study results. By ensuring that the groups are balanced, any observed differences in the outcome can be attributed to the intervention being studied, rather than any preexisting differences between the groups. We conducted analyses at both the household and individual levels to assess balance. Our null hypothesis was tested against the following alternative hypothesis:</p><p xml:id="_wpezKAx">H0: The means of the primary outcome measures in the treatment and control groups were equal.</p><p xml:id="_TC9FuuC">H1: The means of the primary outcome measures in the treatment and control groups were not equal.</p><p xml:id="_p4RAEK6">At the household level, we examined several variables, including consumption, food security, assets, financial inclusion, income, and revenue. Our results indicate that there were no significant differences between the treatment and control groups in these variables, suggesting that the groups were balanced in these key factors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>).</p><p xml:id="_4K8WHEp">Furthermore, at the individual level, we examined variables such as time spent working, physical health, mental health, political involvement, and women's empowerment (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>). Our analyses showed that these variables were also similar between the treatment and control groups, indicating balance at the individual level as well.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_pQcJmcb">Baseline Survey</head><p xml:id="_sCNS5Te">The baseline survey was conducted in June 2018, before any intervention, and served as a point of comparison for the subsequent surveys. This survey collected information on key variables (Appendix B) that could potentially affect the outcome of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_MbkQwh4">Midline Survey</head><p xml:id="_9J7Tq36">Following the baseline survey, we implemented a three-month training program for the treatment group during July-September 2018. The training program was designed to provide skills and knowledge that could improve the outcome of interest. The control group did not receive the training program. We also conducted a midline survey in October 2018 to assess the effectiveness  of the training that was provided to the participants. The midline survey was carried out three months after the start of the intervention, when the training program was concluded. The purpose of the midline survey was to evaluate whether the training was being conducted effectively and to identify any areas that needed improvement. The survey included questions related to the quality of the training sessions, the engagement of the participants, and their level of understanding of the content covered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_wFaq8r3">Endline Survey</head><p xml:id="_YAbdCpR">Six months after the completion of the training and intervention period, we conducted the endline survey in March 2019 to evaluate the impact of the intervention on the outcome of interest.</p><p xml:id="_h5WrDEP">This survey collected the same information as the baseline survey (Appendix B), allowing us to compare the treatment and control groups again. By comparing the results of the endline survey to those of the baseline survey, we could assess whether the intervention had a significant impact on the outcome of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_am6Q7mn">Details of Intervention</head><p xml:id="_7PmDyt7">This Intervention (Graduate Program onwards) consists of six complementary components, each designed to address specific constraints being faced by ultra-poor households:</p><p xml:id="_5VJHEhP">1. Training 2. Productive asset transfer 3. Registration to micro-credit program 4. Regular household visits 5. Compulsory savings 6. Health and hygiene education</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_KmmSM2K">Training</head><p xml:id="_bvCRpAy">In three months, 100 women from the treatment group completed dressmaking and business management training successfully. The dressmaking training included all important aspects of tailoring namely drafting, cutting, and stitching along with the basics of computerized embroidery. In consultation with the trainer, we chalked out lesson plans for trainees. Because most of the trainees were uneducated, the mode of training was practical. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref> shows the average time consumed by the trainees on each session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_f32aygP">Productive Asset Transfer</head><p xml:id="_FbXkjyZ">After completion of the training, a cash stipend was distributed among the groups, the treatment group, and the control group. The primary objective of providing the treatment group with a consumption stipend was twofold: firstly, to promptly enhance and stabilize their level of consumption, and secondly, to mitigate incentives for the sale of the productive assets that were being distributed. All 100 households in the treatment group received PKR 1,000 for one month. Also, all 100 households in the control group received the same amount as this transfer to the treatment group could bias the consumption component in impact evaluation. This transfer corresponds roughly to the monetary equivalent of between 2,402 and 5,142 calories per day (or roughly a kilogram of wheat at local price).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_tzMeqY2">Registration to Micro-Credit Program</head><p xml:id="_W8BgZrY">Households receive weekly training and coaching for 6 months after the completion of the training. The visits were intended to provide accountability, as well as to encourage the participants. In some cases, these visits were reduced to a bi-weekly or monthly basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_WhWmd9z">Regular Household visits</head><p xml:id="_UCFUekg">All the participants from the treatment group were registered to a micro-credit group through PRSP. They were entitled to a loan ranging from PKR 10,000-20,000 each to start up their selected enterprise -dressmaking. The loan amount was transferred after completion of all the training courses. It was made sure that they spent the amount on the purchase of the productive asset and starting their own enterprise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_7FGqyW5">Compulsory Savings</head><p xml:id="_jpbwhFn">To enhance households' resilience to unforeseen circumstances, they were actively encouraged and obliged to engage in savings. To facilitate this, the initial transfer of funds was presented as a loan, prompting recipients to make regular monthly deposits into a designated savings account. This arrangement ensured that households could only access their accumulated savings once they had reached a threshold equal to the value of the asset transfer. They were entitled to repay the loan to the lending agency in one installment after one year or two installments after six months each, depending upon their choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_q6c8ngf">Health and Hygiene education</head><p xml:id="_zGg9RpD">Every household visit encompassed a comprehensive health component that encompassed training on health, nutrition, and hygiene. Additionally, facilitation of healthcare access was provided, either through the direct provision of services by community health workers or through referrals to government or non-governmental organization (NGO) health clinics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_63u5p8c">Results</head><p xml:id="_EHSFrFF">The study used two sampling frames, one for the household-level analysis and the other for individuallevel analysis. The sample size for the householdlevel analysis was 200, while the sample size for the individual-level analysis was 400. The data collected were analyzed using Randomized Controlled Trials to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p xml:id="_cwDZGv2">Table 6 provides a comprehensive overview of the impact evaluation results, presenting them in a family-wise aggregation with q-values adjusted for the 10 indices. The findings suggest that the intervention has had a positive impact on all outcome variables of the treatment group in comparison to the control group. The study reveals that per capita consumption increased by 0.13 standard deviations (q-value 0.001), which translates to an increase of PPP US$4.01 per capita per month. Furthermore, household income and revenue witnessed a surge of 0.43 standard deviations (q-value 0.001), whereas an index of household assets increased by 0.33 standard deviations (q-value 0.052). The study also reports an improvement in the personal lives of the participants, with physical health and mental health experiencing an increase of 0.19 standard deviations (q-value 0.135) and 0.17 standard deviations (q-value 0.135), respectively.</p><p xml:id="_bvxQ4wz">Moreover, the results suggest that the intervention has contributed to increased political involvement by 0.14 (q-value 0.262) and women's empowerment by 0.017 (q-value 0.876). The findings of the study indicated a significant reduction in poverty levels among the households that received the intervention. The results of the RCTs showed that the intervention had a positive impact on the households' income, consumption, and health. The training component of the intervention was found to be particularly effective in improving the households' economic activities, while the cash transfer component helped to alleviate their immediate needs. The microfinance component was effective in enabling households to access capital to invest in their businesses. The following section contains a comprehensive breakdown of the outcomes achieved:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_sQYZXUA">Consumption</head><p xml:id="_byHt6HV">As part of the impact evaluation, the study meticulously examined the households' consumption patterns. The focus was on assessing the changes in total per-capita consumption within the treatment group in comparison to the control group. The analysis presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref>, reveals notable variations between food and non-food consumption, both in absolute terms and relative proportions. Specifically, food consumption exhibited a substantial increase of 11% compared to the control group's mean of $31.1, while non-food consumption showed a more modest increase of 3.7% compared to the control group's mean of $14. Notably, the elasticity of food consumption concerning overall expenditure was found to be greater than one, a significant finding that aligns with Engel's law <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Engel, 1857)</ref>. This observation supports the notion that households with lower incomes allocate a higher proportion of their financial resources toward food, as opposed to middle or higher-income households. These findings shed light on the differential consumption patterns within varying income strata and highlight the relevance of Engel's law in understanding consumption behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ttHPcRx">Food Security</head><p xml:id="_TmSJExt">While there is no significant rise in expenditures on durable goods during the endline assessment, it is worth noting that households in the treatment group possessed a greater number of household assets compared to the control group, as evidenced by the data presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">8</ref>. It is possible that the expenditure variable utilized in the analysis may not fully capture certain expenditures related to durable goods. Nonetheless, an analysis of food security, as depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>.3, reveals a substantial improvement in this aspect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_r2ARHQX">Assets Ownership</head><p xml:id="_PCJPep7">Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">9</ref> presents the empirical findings pertaining to the impact of the intervention on household assets. The analysis reveals statistically significant  increases in asset holdings among households during the endline assessment. Specifically, the constructed asset index exhibits a substantial increase of 0.34 standard deviations. Of particular note is the effect size observed for productive assets, which are utilized in household self-employment endeavors, as it demonstrates the highest magnitude among all asset categories, amounting to 0.32 standard deviations at the endline.</p><p xml:id="_QRhAjzQ">The data further indicates that there is an overall augmentation in both household assets and productive assets, with the latter experiencing a more pronounced increase during the endline period. The value of productive assets exhibits a notable rise of 12% when compared to the control group means, which stand at PPP US$1079. Upon comparing the value of assets held by households at the end of year 1 with the initial value of the transferred asset, it becomes evident that the impact of the program on asset values surpasses the cost of the assets themselves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_dVjgFW8">Financial Inclusion</head><p xml:id="_48ckt5e">In the evaluation of the graduation program, the analysis of the impact on asset holding was a significant component. As reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">10</ref>, the results indicate that households exhibited a statistically significant increase in assets in the endline, with an asset index 0.34 standard deviations larger than the control group mean. It is worth noting that this increase in asset holding was not at the expense of more borrowing or less savings. As indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>, there was a large increase in savings at the endline, with PPP US$61, or 64.7% of the control mean. While savings were mandatory during the first six months of the program, it is still noteworthy that continued savings were not required after the initial six-month period, yet the amount deposited in savings last month and the increase in net savings remained substantial. This suggests that the program not only had a positive impact on asset holding but also on the financial behavior and savings habits of the participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_5FQNuqu">Use of Time</head><p xml:id="_UyKZd9A">The study findings indicate that the productive assets transferred to the households have been effectively utilized. Specifically, the study reports an increase in adult labor supply by 30.6 min per adult per day, representing a 15% increase over  control households at the endline. This increase in labor supply is concentrated on own business activities, which is consistent with the assets chosen by most individuals. The enhanced labor supply combined with increased productive assets has resulted in an increase in revenue from non-farm microenterprises. The evidence of this increase in revenue is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">11</ref>, Column 3. These results provide strong evidence that the transfer of productive assets had a positive effect on the livelihoods of the participating households.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ju4YMmJ">Income and Revenues</head><p xml:id="_BN3EVQM">As a critical aspect of the impact evaluation, the researchers analyzed the income and revenue of the households participating in the intervention. This analysis aimed to determine whether the designed intervention was effective in enhancing the economic status of the households. By comparing the income and revenue levels of the treatment group and the control group, the researchers evaluated the impact of the intervention on the households' economic well-being. The results indicated that the intervention had a positive impact on the households' income and revenue levels. In particular, the treatment group households experienced a significant increase in their income and revenue compared to the control group households. Upon conducting the end-line evaluation, it was observed that there is a substantial improvement in the revenue generated from non-farm micro-enterprises in treatment households as compared to control households. More specifically, the treatment households experienced a 600% increase in revenue, which is significantly higher than the control group's mean of PPP US$2.83, as depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">12</ref>, Column 3. It was also found that the productive assets allocated to households were effectively utilized as the adult labor supply increased by 30.6 min per adult per day at endline, which is a 15% increase over control households. Furthermore, the households reported feeling economically better off, with an improvement of 0.78 points on a scale of 1 to 10, where the control group mean was 3.74. It is noteworthy that all the gains achieved in terms of income and revenue remained persistent even one year after the completion of the program, which suggests the long-term sustainability  of the program's impact on the economic wellbeing of the treated households. This finding indicates the intervention's effectiveness in achieving the intended goal of reducing poverty and improving the economic status of the participating households.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_pe3q8sC">Health</head><p xml:id="_avmXgRB">The detailed physical and mental health results are presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">13</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">14</ref>. The former table reveals a significant positive impact at a statistically significant level of 1% on individuals who have not missed any days of work due to illness and the score for activities of daily living at endline. The findings are indicative of improved physical health status and functionality among the treated households. The results suggest that the program has a positive effect on reducing illness-related absenteeism and improving the ability of individuals to perform essential tasks necessary for daily living.</p><p xml:id="_arK8MkA">According to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">14</ref>, the mental health index at endline is 0.15 standard deviations higher in the treatment group compared to the control group. This indicates a statistically significant improvement in the mental health of the participants in the treatment group. This increase in mental health is driven by a combination of factors, including overall self-reported happiness and the lack of symptoms of mental distress. These findings suggest that the asset transfer program had a positive impact not only on the economic well-being of the households, but also on their mental well-being. These results are important because mental health is an important aspect of overall well-being, and it can have implications for a range of outcomes, including physical health, productivity, and social relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_6uaDdwx">Women Empowerment</head><p xml:id="_uhpthtz">The results about the impact of the program on political and social empowerment, as well as women's empowerment within the household, are presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">15</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">16</ref>. These tables provide valuable insights into the transformation experienced by the initially marginalized beneficiaries within their respective villages. The findings reveal a noteworthy increase in their engagement in political activity and village-level actions, as evidenced by the statistically significant positive impact observed at the 1% level on these particular measures. Importantly, this positive effect remains persistent even one year after the conclusion of the program, suggesting a sustained and enduring impact.</p><p xml:id="_J5kNd77">Furthermore, the program has had a positive impact on women's empowerment within the household. At endline, women in the treatment group reported having a greater say in decisionmaking processes within the household regarding   health expenditures and home improvements, indicating a shift toward greater gender equity. Such changes in social norms could be attributed to the program's emphasis on the inclusion of women in the decision-making process, as well as the training provided to women to enhance their social and economic agency. Overall, the program has had a positive impact on both political and social empowerment, as well as women's empowerment within the household.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_MMSN24n">Conclusion and Policy Recommendations</head><p xml:id="_M6n3cQ2">The graduation program implemented in this research study aimed to alleviate poverty among ultra-poor households by providing them with a comprehensive set of interventions. The study found that the program had a significant positive impact on various outcome variables, including total per capita consumption, asset index, and financial inclusion index, total time spent working, incomes and revenues index, physical health index, and mental health index. Specifically, the program led to an increase in per capita consumption and asset ownership, which suggests that the program was successful in increasing economic well-being among the participants. The program also led to an increase in financial inclusion, as measured by access to formal financial services, which is critical for the long-term sustainability of the households' livelihoods. Additionally, the program had a positive impact on the physical and mental health of the participants, which is a crucial factor in reducing poverty. However, the program did not have a significant impact on food security, women empowerment, and political involvement. These findings suggest that the program could be improved by incorporating additional interventions or by modifying the existing interventions to address these specific outcomes. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that the graduation program is an effective poverty reduction intervention that can improve the economic, physical, and mental well-being of ultra-poor households. The program's success underscores the importance of a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to poverty reduction, which includes productive asset transfers, training, access to credit, compulsory savings, regular household visits, and health and hygiene education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ksRtmUg">Policy Recommendations</head><p xml:id="_WeYGnqz">The findings of the study have several implications for policy decisions. Policymakers and development practitioners can use the evidence-based insights provided by this study to design and implement effective poverty reduction programs that address the multidimensional factors of poverty. The graduation program's success also highlights the importance of investing in long-term poverty reduction strategies that empower households and promote sustainable livelihoods.</p><p xml:id="_REKTuMz">Based on the results, several poverty reduction strategies can be recommended:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_PWMSRcX">Providing Productive assets to Poor Households</head><p xml:id="_qwnDxjy">The results suggest that providing productive assets to poor households can lead to increased income, revenue, and asset accumulation. This can be an effective poverty reduction strategy, especially in rural areas where households often rely on self-employment activities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_zqYJE9b">Skill Training</head><p xml:id="_hpkpeaf">The results of the graduation program indicate that providing skill training can significantly improve household incomes and overall well-being. Therefore, policy changes should be made to ensure that all poverty reduction programs incorporate a skills training component. This can be achieved by collaborating with vocational training institutions or by establishing community-based training programs. Additionally, the skill training programs should be designed to address the specific needs of the community and provide relevant and practical skills that can lead to income-generating activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_FMnwGMn">Encouraging Savings</head><p xml:id="_uxhubr7">The mandatory savings requirement in the program led to a significant increase in savings among beneficiaries. This can be a useful poverty reduction strategy as it can help households build assets and provide a buffer against economic shocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_QFb2QYD">Promoting Access to Credit</head><p xml:id="_nNmrusC">The increase in revenue and income from non-farm micro-enterprises among beneficiaries suggests that access to credit can be an effective poverty reduction strategy. Policymakers can consider implementing policies that provide easier access to credit for poor households.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_XYNzD5G">Empowering Women</head><p xml:id="_rj27sFn">The program had positive effects on women' s empowerment within the household, as they reported having a greater say in decisions related to health expenditures and home improvements. Policies that promote women' s empowerment can lead to better outcomes for households, including poverty reduction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_DFP3hbN">Focusing on Health and Mental Health Interventions</head><p xml:id="_dwNVHVa">The program had positive effects on physical and mental health outcomes among beneficiaries. Policymakers can consider investing in health and mental health interventions as a poverty reduction strategy.</p><p xml:id="_QYtftDE">In conclusion, the findings indicate that an integrated approach that combines various poverty reduction measures can effectively enhance the economic, social, and health outcomes of impoverished households.</p><p xml:id="_9bBbPnw">Sargodha, Pakistan.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_svbudVc">Food Consumption</head><p xml:id="_PcguUQA">Food consumption is valued based on the amount of each type of good that the household consumed. The value of each household's consumption is found by multiplying the total amount consumed by the household in a given time period (typically, either a week or month) by the unit market price of the good. This is true regardless of whether it was a good produced within the home, purchased, or received as a gift. In cases where market price data is not available, the median price among households who did purchase the good is used to determine the unit value, which is then applied to all households.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_7ysAvcH">Nonfood Consumption</head><p xml:id="_AaevpXn">Nonfood consumption includes medical expenditures, school fees and expenses, clothing expenses, household repairs, temptation goods, fuel expenses, festival expenses, (non-work) transportation expenses, and other, country-specific expenses. It does not include any expenses incurred in the running of income-generating activities (such as buying inventory, or purchasing feed for livestock).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_56J9nyp">Weighted Asset Index</head><p xml:id="_dPZnEfH">Households are asked about whether or not they own each of several types of durable goods and livestock, and how many of each type they own. There is also either information on the current value of those livestock, or on the median value of purchased livestock. However, the value of durable goods owned is only measured directly. The households report the current estimated value of the assets they own. Households report whether or not they purchased any of the asset in the last six months and how much they spent, making it possible to estimate the unit value of each durable good. There are many types of assets that are held. For example, goats, cows, televisions and motorbike are common assets that households in report owning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_8c7U5Mb">Activities of Daily Living Score</head><p xml:id="_UAGKKbp">This score is one of the components of the physical health index.

Adult respondents are asked to rank their ability to do the following physical tasks:</p><p xml:id="_crwPbH3">1. Lift a heavy object (10lb) 2. Work all day in the field 3. Walk a 5 km distance without getting tired These components were scored on a binary (0/1) scale, with 1 indicating that the respondent was able to complete the activity without help and 0 if they either would require help or could not do the activity. These three components were then averaged together to get the daily living score. A higher Activities of Daily Living score indicates a more physically capable individual.</p></div>

Have trouble sleeping Households report how many times they had these experiences in the last week. For all the households, variables are recoded, such that a higher score corresponds to fewer times experiencing the negative emotion.

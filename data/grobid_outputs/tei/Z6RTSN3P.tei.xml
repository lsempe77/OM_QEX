In response, BRAC launched the Targeting the Ultra-Poor (TUP) pilot programme in 2002 in 3 districts and scaled to 13 additional districts in 2007. The programme targets women in ultra-poor households and provides income generating assets, multifaceted training on entrepreneurial activities, health and nutrition training, social, legal and political rights support and improved access to curative and preventive health care and shortterm consumption support over a period of two years with the aim of merging them with the mainstream poor. 1  A number of studies have confirmed the positive effects of TUP on the programme's main outcomes such as income, asset holdings and occupation both in the short and long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Prakash and Rana, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Das et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Raza et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Emran et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Misha et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandiera et al., 2017)</ref>. The programme has received wide acclaim and is now being replicated across 20 countries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banerjee et al (2015)</ref> performed RCTs across six of these locations and found that the programme produces a significant and costeffective impact on consumption and improves the psychological conditions of the participants, although lasting impacts might be reduced by improvements in broader employment opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bauchet et al., 2015)</ref>. Similar, but cash rather than asset, transfer programs targeted at ultra-poor women in Uganda and Kenya also showed large effects of similar magnitude on microenterprise ownership, asset accumulation incomes and savings <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Blattman et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Blattman et al., , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gobin et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_WtmxbZc">While TUP also has an important health and nutrition related component and has been shown to improve physical and mental <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2018.09.011">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2018.09.011</ref>  <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2018.09.011">0167-6296/© 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_2dhDAcw">health of participating ultra-poor women <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandiera et al., 2017)</ref>, evidence on the program's effect on child health is limited. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jalal and Frongillo (2013)</ref> find positive effects on the weight-for-height z-scores (WHZ) of children aged 24-36 months (0.32 SD), but no effects on other anthropometric outcomes or in other age-groups. This study however uses a non-experimental design and relies on a control group of children that live within the TUP targeted areas. If spill-over effects within these areas did lead to nutritional improvement among the controls, the impact estimates of TUP on child anthropometric outcomes reported will be underestimated. Indeed important socioeconomic spill-overs of TUP have been found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandiera et al. (2017)</ref>, especially on households that are socially connected to the participating households.</p><p xml:id="_Rp6gQcd">This paper contributes to the literature on TUP by evaluating the program's impact on childhood undernutrition. We use the randomized rollout of the program to identify its causal impact on the nutritional status of children in participating households and spill-over effects to children in non-participant households living in the same area as the participating households. Establishing the impact of TUP on childhood undernutrition is important given the high and persistent undernutrition rates in rural Bangladesh, where the prevalence of wasting among children younger than 5 is 39% <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Rahman et al., 2009)</ref>. Such high burden of childhood undernutrition is not only an acute public health problem, but also has important consequences for cognitive development and hence productivity in later adult life and increases risks and associated costs, of contracting chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases in adult life <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Black et al., 2013)</ref>. Moreover, undernourished girls are more likely to have poorer pregnancy outcomes later in life, creating an intergenerational cycle of undernutrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Black et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Black et al., , 2013))</ref>. Given these important long-term consequences, evidence of the impact of TUP on childhood undernutrition both on participants and spill-over effects to non-participants, can greatly contribute to the debate around the cost-effectiveness of such large-scale asset transfer programs targeting women in ultra-poor households.</p><p xml:id="_BJVQGqg">Childhood undernutrition is related to poor maternal and child care practices, inappropriate food intake and prevalence of infectious diseases related to unsafe public health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gartner et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2013)</ref>. While TUP is a nutrition-sensitive program targeting women in ultra-poor households, it is not focused on reducing undernutrition, does not include food transfers and therefore can be expected to impact on each of these channels. The move to more entrepreneurial activities and the associated income gains, triggered by the program can also lead to improved food security and food quality within the participant households. <ref type="bibr">Haseen and Sulaiman (2007)</ref> find that the programme led to both an increase in mean calorie intake from 1750 to 2138 per day and in the quality of the calories consumed among participating ultra-poor women. The program induces participating ultra-poor women and other adults and children in the household to spend more hours on livestock rearing and land cultivation. This could lower children's nutritional outcomes via reduced maternal time investment and increased child labour. TUP also facilitates access to the Essential Health Care package which includes several components such as the provision of access to primary health care and a health promotion campaign. Community Health Promoters regularly inform women about appropriate (breast) feeding practices and preventive care measures. Furthermore, the program guarantees access to sanitary latrines to the participants, either through a direct transfer or to facilities close by via negotiations with its owners.</p><p xml:id="_269wBUh">While these program components are targeted at program participants, it is likely for effects, especially those related to feeding and hygienic practices, to spill-over to non-participant poor households within the same locations. The Mexican conditional cash transfer program PROGRESA (later renamed Oportunidades) for example was found to not only have important spill-over effects on consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angelucci and De Giorgi, 2009)</ref>, asset ownership <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barrientos and Sabatés-Wheeler, 2011)</ref> and schooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bobonis and Finan, 2009)</ref> but also on the use of preventive care and especially on participation in annual growth monitoring of children <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bouckaert, 2014)</ref>. 2 TUP provides health and nutrition training, organised through repeated training sessions, which might spillover/spread via social networks towards households of similar socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Banerjee et al., 2013)</ref>. The importance of the knowledge gained through interventions can result in explicit or implicit signalling by participants and its subsequent effects can instigate "demonstration effects" among non-participating households <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Miguel and Kremer, 2014)</ref>. Spill-overs onto other-poor households could further occur via improved public health conditions.</p><p xml:id="_dMVgAn6">This study uses a two-wave panel dataset ( <ref type="formula">2007 and 2011</ref>) from a randomly rolled out TUP programme that was in place between 2007 and 2009 in 13 of the poorest districts in Bangladesh. We first evaluate the impact of the program on the nutritional status of under-five children in participant ultra-poor households and subsequently investigate spill-over effects on children from nonparticipant households. We distinguish between spill-over effects on the other-poor and non-poor. As gender inequality is high on the policy agenda in Bangladesh, TUP has been designed to target women within ultra-poor households, and the impact of TUP, and anti-poverty programmes more generally, has been linked to the gender of the main recipients <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Berger, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Roy et al., 2015)</ref>, we investigate the heterogeneity of impact across sex of the household head and the child. We further consider age-heterogeneity in the impact of TUP (and spill-overs) on child undernutrition as the first 1000 days between conception and the second year of life are crucial for height-for-age and stunting <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Black et al., 2013)</ref>, while no age window of similar importance has been identified for weightfor-height or wasting. Lastly, we shed light on the potential role of pathways, related to food intake, feeding and caring practices, infectious disease prevalence and hygienic environment, through which TUP might impact on children's nutritional status.</p><p xml:id="_9PyThuc">We find considerable evidence of impact on the nutritional status of children in participant ultra-poor households. The effects are most notable for the weight-for-height indicator -the continuous z score calculated using the WHO 2006 growth standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Borghi et al., 2006)</ref> -, resulting in a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of under-five children wasting (12.5 percentage points <ref type="bibr">[pp]</ref>).Results also suggest TUP to have significant spill-over effects among poor non-participant households living in treated communities. The likelihood of wasting among children in these households reduces by 8.9pp. Analysis of the heterogeneity of effects provide no evidence for improved child nutritional status when the household is headed by women or when the child is male. We find more evidence of TUP effects and spill-overs depending on child age. Younger children experience larger improvements of WHZ, but not wasting; while there is weaker evidence of a small but positive effect of TUP on stunting for ultra-poor children under 2. Subsequently, analysing potential mediators of TUP, we find a significant increase in improved hygiene practices and higher food security. Duration of exclusive breastfeeding also increases among poor participating and non-participating households although exogenous variation in nutritional determinants (on top of the RCT induced variation) is lacking to establish the causal impact of these determinants on undernutrition. Moreover, since 2 Spill-over effects are typically a third of the average treatment on the treated effects when it comes to consumption and more than a fifth for asset holdings (land and livestock). Magnitudes of spill-over effects for preventative care varies between 12% and 80% of the main impact across outcomes. TUP consists of the combined and simultaneous introduction of different programmatic components (assets, entrepreneurial support, health and nutrition training, improved health care access), these effects reflect the combined (and not the separate) impact of the individual components on the nutritional status of under-five children.</p><p xml:id="_qqbtchs">The paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 describes the TUP programme, section 3 describes the data followed by the empirical strategy in section 4. Section 5 presents the results while section 6 provides a discussion and concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2." xml:id="_Wphq4u9">The TUP Programme</head><p xml:id="_nEpghJg">Evidence shows that NGOs traditionally find it challenging to reach women in ultra-poor households for various interventions as they typically lack the skills and the means to participate in such programmes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Navajas et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hashemi and Rosenberg, 2006)</ref>. To explicitly reach this elusive population, BRAC used a three-step targeting procedure for TUP. Geographic selection, based on the World Food Programme poverty map, was first carried out to identify the poorest 13 districts of Bangladesh. Next, BRAC officials from sub-districts of the 13 districts scoped their respective areas to identify the most vulnerable branches, consisting of a few villages/communities, within their sub-district. A random selection of these branches were selected for TUP (see section 3 for more details). The last step combined the use of wealth ranking exercises (WRE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chambers, 1994)</ref> and verification surveys in each of the villages to identify ultra-poor households. All households within each of the villages are then divided into relative wealth ranks. Households in the bottom rank are considered the poorest and are subject to verification surveys to ensure eligibility. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref>TUP eases the innate restrictions of a resource and skill poor household through the provision of income generating assets valued at approximately USD $560 (in 2007 PPP terms) and a comprehensive livelihood development training programme to encourage entrepreneurship and health, nutrition, social, legal and political awareness (also valued at USD $560 in 2007 PPP terms) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandiera et al., 2017)</ref>. Both resources and training are targeted to the women in the ultra-poor households. Selected participants enrol in the programme in 2007 and stay in the programme for two years. After graduation from the programme, participants are left on their own. Several programmatic components are triggered at the onset: selection of the income generating assets, provision and access to healthcare services, social integration activities through community mobilization and awareness campaigns and most importantly, the hands-on coaching (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The income generating assets typically comprise of some combination of cows, goats, poultry or vegetation nurseries that are best suited for the capacity of the participant and local conditions such as access to grazing grounds. Participating women's preferences are considered, but the final selection of income generating assets are decided by the BRAC official. The hands-on coaching sessions, typically done on a weekly or bi-weekly basis either in a home or classroom setting, cover topics ranging from how to care for and grow the assets, developing entrepreneurial skills, acquiring basic education, social and political awareness and health and nutrition training. Three months into the program, once the participating women have achieved some confidence and technical knowledge, assets are transferred to the households along with consumption support (equivalent to approximately $2/week) to cover the opportunity cost of maintaining the assets until they can start to generate income and the mandatory savings scheme (minimum of $0.25/week). The duration of the consumption support, mostly ranging from 3 to 9 months, is determined based on the anticipated time it may take to start generating returns from the assets.</p><p xml:id="_xEcBkDp">Association with TUP also grants the participating households access to the Essential Health Care package that includes, besides home visits from community health promoters and doctor referrals, health and nutrition education that covers topics such as importance of exclusively breastfeeding until the 6 th month, child immunization, pregnancy care, oral rehydration therapy, provision of basic curative care for common illnesses at cost, or free if the patient is unable to pay and the delivery of DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short course) for tuberculosis patients. Participants are also actively encouraged to participate in free promotional drives implemented by local governments in primary health centres aimed to increase uptake of Vitamin A supplementation and child immunization. The rationale behind these components is to develop health awareness, change "unfelt need" to "felt need" and control disease transmission. All training sessions are done on a one-to-one basis, usually within the confines of the participant's home.</p><p xml:id="_RugTKd8">TUP creates an influx of agricultural assets in the treated communities, precipitates a shift in the hours devoted from wage to self-employment among the poorest women in the community and increases self-employment output (e.g. milk, eggs) in the local markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandiera et al., 2017)</ref>. These shifts to self-employment and gains in income among participating ultra-poor households might improve children's nutritional outcomes directly via improved food security and food quality and indirectly via improved maternal stature and weight which crucially affect child anthropometric outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Black et al., 2013)</ref>. But the direct impact could also be negative when increased investments in entrepreneurial activities (or associated child labour) reduce time available for child investments, although <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandiera et al. (2017)</ref> find no reduction of school attendance. While TUP does not include direct food transfers, the program improves access to health care, information about appropriate caring practices (such as breastfeeding) and access to sanitary latrines which could reduce infectious disease prevalence among children. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandiera et al. (2017)</ref> purport that the move of ultra-poor women into self-employment causes spill-over effects in local wages, in particular an increase in market wages for paid agricultural work and maid work due to transition, but these general equilibrium effects are probably less important for child undernutrition as total earnings of non-participating women were not affected. Behavioural spill-over effects have not been studied in previous studies. The TUP revolves around repeated dissemination of messages through in-depth and repeated training sessions on various topics, including health and nutrition, to ensure information retention. Social networks and the "word of mouth" are quite fluid in rural communities and information is likely transmitted through households within similar socioeconomic strata or living in the same local area <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Scott, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Banerjee et al., 2013)</ref>. TUP further stimulates awareness campaigns which might foster "demonstration-effects" of good behaviours among other-poor households <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Handa et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Miguel and Kremer, 2014)</ref>, but plausibly less among non-poor households which might already exhibit the behaviours or which might be less affected by notions of social desirability derived from campaigns geared towards the ultra-poor. There might also be supply-side spill-over effects onto other-poor households via improved supply of food, reduced infectious disease prevalence or improved public health conditions such as access to safe drinking water and sanitation in the local area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3." xml:id="_8yyuEtV">Data</head><p xml:id="_fpEkEGZ">We use the data that was sampled by the Research and Evaluation Division of BRAC and used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandiera et al. (2017)</ref> to assess the socioeconomic returns to TUP. The data for the study was collected from randomly selected sub-districts in each of the 13 poorest districts of Bangladesh. 4 The evaluation team only included sub-districts with at least two branches, with each branch encompassing a few villages. In total, 40 branches were included and randomization was implemented at the branch, rather than village, level to limit spill-overs from treatment to control villages. Randomization occurred in a pair-wise manner within each subdistrict such that one branch was randomly assigned as treated and the other as control branch. Each of the branch offices within the sub-districts typically operate within a 5 km radius while the branches on average are 12 km apart. None of the surveyed households in either the treated or control branches was aware of TUP at baseline. 5 In line with the women-centric approach of TUP, the primary respondent was the main female member of the household. All surveys were conducted between April and December in each of the respective years, but the exact date or month of interview was not recorded. More details on the data collection is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandiera et al. (2017)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_BWgAWPR">Three groups of households were surveyed in each of the villages: (i) the ultra-poor (UP), (ii) the other-poor (OP), that is, those who were primarily selected during the WRE but later disqualified during the verification surveys and (iii) the non-poor (NP). The data includes virtually all ultra-poor and near-poor households in the villages in each of the 40 branches and a 10% random sample of the non-poor households. Our identification strategy for the effect of participation in TUP relies on a comparison of the UP households across participating and non-participating branches, while spill-over effects are identified from a comparison of OP (and respectively NP) households across participating and nonparticipating branches.</p><p xml:id="_vq7MQDm">After deleting observations due to item non-response, preintervention data (2007) amasses information from 2849 children aged below five from UP households, 5467 under-five children from OP households and 2578 under-five children from NP households. Follow-up data was collected within the same households in 2011.

We follow the UNICEF (1990) nutrition framework which distinguishes between immediate determinants, underlying and basic determinants. As such, interventions to reduce undernutrition can also operate on different levels: (i) nutrition specific (food intake and health), (ii) nutrition sensitive (behavioural, feeding, caring practices) and (iii) building an enabling environment (distal determinants such as socioeconomic status, access to health services, safe and hygienic environment) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Horton and Lo, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Black et al., 2013)</ref>.

In this two-period setting, ANCOVA boils down to modelling posttreatment nutritional outcomes of ultra-poor children as a function of their treatment status and their pre-treatment nutritional outcomes. In practice, we estimate the following linear regression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y i,post = ˇ0 + X i,pre ˇ1 + ˇ2D i + ˇ3Y i,pre + ε i (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p xml:id="_ckafmb9">where Y i,post indicates the post-treatment nutritional outcome of child i, X i,pre represents the vector of baseline (pre-treatment) child and household characteristics, Y i,pre captures the pre-treatment nutritional outcome of child i and ε i is a random error term which we allow to cluster at the branch level to account for the TUP experiment's randomization occurring at the branch level. Given the broad scope of TUP, we control for baseline, rather than time varying household characteristics as these could potentially be affected by the treatment. D i is a treatment dummy equalling one for branches where TUP was implemented and zero otherwise. Under the assumption that there are no unobservables correlated with the rollout of TUP and the outcomes of interest, ˇ2 represents the treatment effect of the TUP program on children in UP households. Potential spill-overs from treatment to control villages are unlikely since randomization was applied to the branches, rather than the villages and as branches are typically not adjacent (section 3 provides more information on distance between branches). The RCT design further allows identifying spill-over effects from a comparison of under-fives in OP (respectively NP) households across treated and control branches and estimated on the balanced sample of OP (respectively NP) children using the same specification (1). Indeed, the discussion on balancing in the previous section raised no particular concerns about unobservables affecting outcomes of OP (respectively NP) children and/or whether these children were living in a branches where UP households got treated or not. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">12</ref>ANCOVA was recently proposed as an alternative to the more commonly used difference-in-difference (DiD) fixed effects estimator for evaluation of randomized programmes such as TUP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McKenzie (2012)</ref> shows that ANCOVA has more power than DiD and the improvement in power is larger when the pre-treatment (Y i,pre ) outcome has little predictive power for the post-treatment outcome (Y i,post ). Under these circumstances, the variance of the difference between the post-and pre-treatment variable is larger than the variance of the post-treatment variable and ANCOVA accounts for the degree of correlation with baseline outcomes via the ˇ3 -parameter in specification (1), while DiD always 'fully' corrects for baseline differences even when the correlation is low. The raw autocorrelation in our balanced panel is around 30 percent for WHZ and HAZ and thus the gains in power from using ANCOVA might be substantive and important because the balanced sample is relatively small.</p><p xml:id="_CpzC8vK">The women-centric approach of TUP is motivated by the expected positive effects on women's bargaining power within the household which in turn should lead to more investments in children's health and schooling. There is however little empirical support for this assumption. Cash transfer programs have not been found to produce different effects when cash is given to the father or mother within the household <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Benhassine et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Haushofer and Shapiro, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Roy et al. (2015)</ref> find that while women do retain ownership of the livestock transferred to them by TUP, their overall mobility and resource control is reduced and that men are more likely to own newly acquired assets. To analyze this hypothesis, we allow the effects of TUP on childhood undernutrition to differ between households that are female headed, constitute 7% of the baseline balanced sample (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A2</ref>) and those that are male headed at baseline. On the other hand, gender based discrimination in favour of male children, especially in terms of food consumption is not uncommon in Bangladesh (WFP, 2012) and might result in smaller impacts for girls as compared to boys. To investigate the gender related heterogeneity of the effects (using the balanced panel of UP children) and spill-overs (using the balanced panels of OP and NP children) of TUP on child nutritional outcomes, we extend model (1) through the inclusion of two interaction terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Y i,post = ˇ0 + X i,pre ˇ1 + ˇ2D i + ˇ3Y i,pre + ˇ4D i MAH i,pre +ˇ5D i MA i + ε i<label>(2)</label></formula><p xml:id="_cg8YQDq">where MAH i,pre and MA i equal 1 if the head of the household and the child are male at baseline. Specification (1) imposes that the effect and potential spillovers of TUP on child undernutrition is identical for children of different ages, but this might be an oversimplifying assumption because particular age windows have been shown to matter more for anthropometrics than others; and because of the particular age composition of our balanced panel. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Black et al. (2013)</ref> stress that most stunting originates during the first 1000 days from conception to a child's second birthday, with longer-lasting impacts on health and anthropometric measures after the age of 2. We therefore expect TUP to reveal a stronger impact on HAZ and stunting among children below the age of 2 compared to those between 2 and 5, although the latter group might still experience positive growth effects, in particular when they were exposed to TUP at younger ages.</p><p xml:id="_Zsbzt7w">villages with a large number of UP households. We nevertheless did not consider treatment heterogeneity in spill-overs across the number of UP households per village in 2007 as there is only limited variability in this number. Among all villages that have at least one child featuring in the balanced UP, OP or NP panels, more than 80% has fewer than 12 UP households per village.</p><p xml:id="_ksaX8X5">Investigating age-related heterogeneities in effect and spillovers of the program on height growth is however difficult with the balanced sample of under-fives. Save measurement error, these children should be 4-5 years old in the 2011 wave, or between 0 and 12 months in the 2007 wave. By the start date of the program, a substantial share of the crucial first 1000 days has therefore already passed; and if additionally time is required for the program to affect the determinants of height growth, the effect and spill-overs of TUP in the balanced sample might well be modest or even absent. In contrast, the under-five children born after the start of TUP, which we only observe in 2011 and are all younger than 4, 13 have all been exposed to the program and can be subdivided in those younger and older than 2; although age-related heterogeneities in this sample could also partly reflect differences in the duration of exposure to TUP.</p><p xml:id="_aZHhvJX">We therefore pool both samples to estimate age-related heterogeneities in the effect and spill-overs of TUP on HAZ and stunting. Since ANCOVA requires conditioning on baseline information, we replace missing values for baseline controls/outcomes with zeroes (respectively X O i,pre and Y O i,pre ) and add a dummy for missing baseline outcomes/controls (M i,pre ) to specification (1). 14 We further introduce interaction effects between the treatment dummy and age categories:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Y i,post = ˇ0 + X 0 i,pre ˇ1 + ˇ02 2 D i A 02 i + ˇ24 2 D i A 24 i + ˇ45 2 D i A 45 i +ˇ3Y 0 i,pre + ˇ4M i,pre + ε i<label>(3)</label></formula><p xml:id="_WV9DVaz">where A lk i is a dummy equalling 1 when the child's age is between l and k.</p><p xml:id="_zQcTpYH">While there is less evidence about particular crucial age windows for WHZ z-scores or wasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Black et al., 2013)</ref>, we apply specification (3) also on these weight-related outcomes for consistency. We further use the same specification for identifying potential mediators (breastfeeding, food security, infectious disease prevalence, access to sanitary toilet and availability of safe drinking water) through which TUP might affect or spill-over onto childhood undernutrition, although this specification cannot establish the causal link from the pathways to the indicators of childhood undernutrition. Finally, we use specification (3), but without interaction effects, to test robustness of our estimate of specification (1) obtained from the relatively small balanced compared to those derived from the much larger pooled sample.</p></div>

While the densities are alike at baseline, the density of WHZ z-scores for ultra-poor children participating in TUP shifts more to the right over time than the density for the non-participating ultra-poor households, even though both densities show a reduction in spread compared to baseline. Interestingly, such a clear-cut pattern is not evident for HAZ, although 13 A small share of these children are older than 4 in 2011, partly reflecting measurement error but also missing data in 2007 due to item-non-response. 14 In other words, compared to DiD, which would disregard children born after the start of the programme as the individual fixed effects cannot be differenced out with missing baseline outcomes, ANCOVA has more power for a given sample size and allows using a much larger sample.

A similar pattern for WHZ and HAZ is visible for the OP households living in TUP targeted areas, suggesting that spill-over effects indeed exist, though the size of the shifts are substantially smaller and more concentrated at the bottom and middle of the WHZ distribution. There is no differential pattern in WHZ and HAZ between targeted and control areas among non-poor households. These trends are suggestive of a strong effect of TUP participation on WHZ (wasting) and substantial spill-overs to WHZ among OP (but not NP) households, but no effect or spill-over effect on HAZ (stunting).

We find no significant effects on HAZ (increase of 0.076 SD) or stunting (5.6pp reduction) among participating UP children and these effect sizes are much smaller compared to the absolute effect sizes on WHZ and wasting, or in relative terms compared to the baseline means of HAZ and stunting.</p><p xml:id="_Gk32RrS">Restricting the sample to children of OP households in both treated and control branches allows estimating spill-over effects of TUP on those children.

WHZ zscores are increased by 0.420 SD, resulting in an 8.9pp drop in the probability of being wasted. No significant impact is found on HAZ or the stunting indicator. We further find no evidence of spill-over effects to children of NP households, although wasting seems to increase somewhat among NP children in treated branches. The latter effect becomes insignificant or small when baseline controls are removed or when the much larger sample including observations which missing baseline information is used (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">A4a</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">18</ref>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> further presents evidence on gender-differences in TUP effects and spill-over effects.

We first re-estimate all models while allowing the covariates, including socioeconomic status and occupational opportunities, to vary over time (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">A4c</ref>). We find results to be very robust to including time-varying covariates. 19  Next, we re-estimate the marginal effects in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, but allow the (spill-over) effect of TUP to differ across child age. This might matter for height gain, where the first 1000 days between conception and a child's second birthday are of crucial importance, while there is no clear-cut window for WHZ or wasting. We use the pooled sample as it allows differentiating between children plausibly exposed during the first crucial 1000 days since conception (i.e. the children born after the start of the programme), which we can further decompose in those younger than 2 and those between 2 and 4; and those born before the program started.

The program does however reveal age-differentiation in its impact on WHZ, but not on wasting. Younger children among UP and OP households, particularly those under 2, experience a stronger improvement of WHZ compared to the group of 2-4 year olds; while being born before or after the start of the program is less important. We thus conclude that the absence of a TUP effect on z-scores and stunting in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> is probably not driven by children in the balanced panel being affected by the program only after a considerable share of the crucial window of 1000 days has passed. Rather, our estimates suggest that TUP had little effect on height-related measures of undernutrition. In contrast, the program affected WHZ, more strongly among younger children, although age-heterogeneity of the effect was not located at the lower end of the WHZ distribution as indicated by a homogenous impact on wasting.</p><p xml:id="_HMp4AWs">Next we identify the impact and spill-overs of the program on the underlying determinants of childhood undernutrition. While these estimates cannot inform on the causal effect of these program-affected determinants on WHZ and wasting (which would require additional exogenous variation in the determinants of undernutrition), our estimates allow reducing the potential set of determinants to those that have actually been affected by the TUP program. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> presents these estimates, which have been obtained from applying ANCOVA specification (3) on the pooled sample. The exceptions are the probability and duration of breastfeeding which are estimated from children born after 2008 since breastfeeding is only reported for children younger than 36 months (explaining why we do not condition on baseline controls and baseline breastfeeding). We find no impact on the probability of breastfeeding among UP, OP and NP children 21 , which is not surprising given almost universal breastfeeding in the control branches (respectively 97.8%; 98.5% and 99.3% among UP, OP and NP households). The impact on the duration of exclusive breastfeeding is however large. TUP causes mothers in ultra-poor households to increase the duration of exclusive breastfeeding up to 180 days compared to 107 days in control branches; while the spill-over effect to other-poor children is 53 days (171 versus 118 days) and absent among NP children (116 versus 119 days). The impact is equally large for children younger/older than 2 in 2011 suggesting that the extended duration of exclusive breastfeeding remained also for children born after 2009 when households graduated from the TUP programme (see column 'age 0-2 = age 2-4 ). 22 Food security increases within 21 While the spill-overs to OP children are statistically significant at the 5% level, the magnitude of the effects are tiny. 22 The extended duration of exclusive breastfeeding, and its lasting effect for children born after households graduated from the programme, is most likely not driven by reduced fertility which would allow mothers to invest more time per child.</p><p xml:id="_PfSTc6q">Table A5 reports household level estimates, derived from the balanced panel, of models explaining the number of alive children in 2011 that were born after 2007 as a function of treatment status, controlling for household size and composition. We do this separately for children in UP, OP and NP households, and also for the number of alive children in 2011 born after 2009 when households had already graduated from TUP. In all models, treatment status did not significantly (at 5% level) affect the number of children born after 2007/2009. While unlikely, missing data on the reasons for attrition, including death, does not allow ruling out that our estimated zero fertility effect is masking the combination of reduced fertility and UP households, but there are no spill-overs towards OP and NP households. 23 The probability of being able to secure at least two meals every day increases from 74% to 90% in UP households and is similar for UP children born after/before the start/graduation from the program suggesting that food security was improved in the long run in UP households. Also the availability of sanitary toilets increases substantially (80% versus 55% in UP and 76% versus 64% in OP households), though this does not appear to result in a reduction of infectious disease prevalence which was already low at baseline (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">A3</ref>). Interestingly, the impact is uniform across age categories in UP household, but not among OP households where younger children (i.e. those born after graduating from the program) experience a larger increase in accessibility.</p></div>

We further note that all included households had at least one alive under-five child in 2007. 23 While the point estimates are statistically significant for children aged 2-4 and 4-5 in NP households, we neither reject the hypothesis that the TUP programme had no overall impact on food security (column 'age 0-2 = age 2-4 = age 4-5' = 0), nor the hypothesis that the impact differed across age categories (column 'age 0-2 = age 2-4 = age 4-5').  with long-lasting effects on adult health and socio-economic status. This paper exploits the randomized rollout of the Targeting the Ultra-Poor (TUP) anti-poverty program in Bangladesh to identify the program's impact on the nutritional status of under-five children in the period 2007-2011. We investigate the program's impact on children in participating ultra-poor households, spill-over effects to non-participants, heterogeneous impact effects and potential pathways of impact. We find considerable impact of the program on ultra-poor children's nutritional status. The program causes marked improvements in WHZ of UP children, which leads to large reductions in the probability of being wasted (12.5pp). Younger children experience larger improvements of WHZ, but there is no heterogeneous impact on wasting and differences in effectiveness across child and household head gender do not reach statistical significance. While gender based discrimination biased towards males, especially for children, is not uncommon in Bangladesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(WFP, 2012)</ref>, the lack of significant gender related heterogeneity may be indicative of the success of a large number social awareness programmes, including the TUP, working to address this issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kabeer et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_xwvsXW7">The program also has important spill-over effects among nonparticipating children living in households with similar levels of socioeconomic status. Children from poor households not selected for TUP but residing in the same branches, experience improvements in nutritional outcomes that are 40 to 70 percent as those experienced by children from participating ultra-poor households. No such spill-over effects are found for non-poor households. We further find that male children in OP households experience larger improvements in WHZ compared to female children in OP households, but the exact reasons for gender heterogeneity being limited to OP households require further research.</p><p xml:id="_XYtamxU">Our effects on the ultra-poor are significantly larger in magnitude than those found in an earlier study of the same programme by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jalal and Frongillo (2013)</ref>, most likely because the latter study did not have experimental data and used the other-poor households as a counterfactual. As we show that spill-over effects to these other-poor are quite substantial, such a comparison will lead to an underestimation of the actual program impact. Moreover, our effects are not larger than estimates of maximum achievable effect reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bhutta et al. (2013)</ref> and obtained from a simulated scale up of interventions, many of which are, at least partly, included in TUP. Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jalal and Frongillo (2013)</ref>, we find TUP does not increase height-for-age z-scores, despite weak evidence for a stronger impact on stunting among ultra-poor children under 2, compared to older children, which is in line with work stressing the importance of the first 1000 days after conception <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Black et al., 2013)</ref>. The lack of an effect on HAZ is worrisome, as stunting more accurately reflects the nutritional deficiencies and illnesses that occur during the early-life period that will hamper growth and development and, therefore, is preferred as a reliable indicator of long-term undernutrition (World Bank Group and UNICEF, 2016).</p><p xml:id="_xtyrrVA">We are unable to identify which component of TUP is most effective in raising children's nutritional status, as the different TUP components were simultaneously implemented and as there was no variation in the program implementation across locations. Most likely it is exactly this comprehensive, integrated and multi-sectoral approach that is important for explaining the program's success as it may impact a wide range of childhood undernutrition determinants <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Garrett et al., 2011)</ref>. Our results show that food intake, improved sanitation and exclusive breastfeeding duration were improved by TUP. Food security increased in participant ultra-poor households, but not among OP or NP households suggesting that the additional income generated by increasing self-employment (and the lack of general equilibrium effects in earnings), plays an important role. Food security might directly impact food intake of the under-five children, but could also improve maternal anthropometrics, which is in line with improved maternal physical and mental health of ultra-poor women reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandiera et al. (2017)</ref> and which are important for child undernutrition outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Black et al., 2017)</ref>. Spill-overs were likely more important for access to sanitary toilets since both UP and OP households increased access. The duration of exclusive breastfeeding was extended with 73 and 53 days for ultra-poor and other-poor households respectively, again suggesting the importance of demonstration effects and/or 'leakage' of the awareness raising efforts to the other-poor as these activities are typically carried out in open spaces such as front courtyards.</p><p xml:id="_7YnxVQH">An important question is whether these program-affected determinants could explain the large program impact on WHZ and the much smaller insignificant effect on HAZ. The study design, which lacks exogenous variation in the different determinants, does not allow establishing their respective causal impacts on childhood undernutrition. Nevertheless, a reason for the lack of impact on stunting might be the relatively short time period over which we evaluate effects. As there is potential for catch-up growth up to the age of 12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adair, 1999)</ref>, it is possible that increases in the weight-based measures will still translate into increased height. Food security and access to safe and hygienic environments are probably important for WHZ, but the case for extended duration of breastfeeding is less obvious, since weight gains were equally impressive among children born before TUP was implementedour balanced panel of under-five children -and because the literature does report different findings with one literature review showing little evidence for breastfeeding promotion impacting infant weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Black et al., 2013)</ref> and another stating that breastfeeding practices are important for wasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bhutta et al., 2013)</ref>. TUP's effect on the duration of breastfeeding are also impressive compared to those found in some more nutrition-specific interventions. For instance, the Bangladesh Integrated Nutritional Project (BINP) implemented at scale by the World Bank aimed to improve maternal and child nutritional status by increasing the knowledge of caring practices via training and education. The program also included supplementary feeding to complement the education component. While the midterm effects were modest <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Pelletier et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">White, 2005)</ref>, the impact was no longer significantly different from zero by the end of the program <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hossain, 2005)</ref>. This might suggest that even though the TUP did not financially reward women for improved feeding, the intensive follow-up and large cash transfer did raise women's susceptibility to adopting the behavior promoted in the awareness raising visits. It is therefore imperative to consider the effects reported in this paper as those of the entire TUP program and not only of as those of the awareness raising/education campaign. The substantial spill-over effects to non-poor households, who did not receive any cash transfer, do however suggest that the increased duration of breastfeeding is not merely a consequence of the large financial incentive.</p><p xml:id="_qHayQFA">While we acknowledge that respondents may have exaggerated changes in desired behaviors (social desirability bias) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Edwards, 1957)</ref>; important childhood undernutrition determinants, such as child food intake, were not recorded in the data; and other limitations of using these results to draw more general conclusions on effective strategies to reduce undernutrition, our results do have important implications for assessing the cost-effectiveness of large multifaceted interventions such as TUP. The substantial long-term benefits such programmes can generate on child health outcomes could contribute to breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty.</p><p xml:id="_VSQaKyf">Ultra-poor households Other poor households Non-poor households Treated areas Control areas Normalized differences Treated areas Control areas Normalized differences Treated areas Control areas Normalized differences Sample: Male children Weight for height (WHZ) -1.154 -1.480 0.274 -1.057 -1.090 0.027 -1.044 -0.928 -0.091 Wasting (WHZ&lt;-2SD) (1/0) 0.241 0.312 -0.158 0.245 0.192 0.127 0.246 0.182 0.154 Height for age (HAZ) -2.216 -2.197 -0.014 -1.982 -2.070 0.063 -1.893 -1.806 -0.063 Stunting (HAZ&lt;-2SD) (1/0) 0.523 0;624 -0.205 0.485 0.515 -0.058 0.474 0.416 0.116 Observations 199 93 241 307 114 137 Sample: Female children Weight for height (WHZ) -1.030 -1.375 0.304 -1.229 -1.102 -0.102 -0.944 -0.953 0.007 Wasting (WHZ&lt;-2SD) (1/0) 0.182 0.236 -0.133 0.248 0.213 0.082 0.170 0.140 0.084 Height for age (HAZ) -1.838 -1.845 0.005 -1.9110 -1.959 0.037 -1.762 -1.579 -0.123 Stunting (HAZ&lt;-2SD) (1/0) 0.524 0.449 0.149 0.469 0.467 0.006 0.415 0.336 0.163 Observations 187 89 262 300 135 143 Notes: Data for this analysis was collected from 13 districts in northern Bangladesh by the Research and Evaluation Division of BRAC.

Each leave-one-out regression is obtained after removing one of the 40 branches from the sample.</figDesc><graphic coords="15,60.01,478.52,217.44,154.94" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Baseline controls include age and sex of the child, sex of the household head, household size, education and employment status of the household head, per capita income, ownership of land, livestock and savings. Heterogeneous effects are obtained from specification (3). Effects on the continuous z-scores should be interpreted in terms of standard deviations from the median of the WHO international reference group. Data for this analysis was collected from 13 districts in northern Bangladesh by the Research and Evaluation Division of BRAC. Standard errors are clustered at the branch level. *, ** indicate significance at 5% and 1% per cent respectively.

We did not reject the null hypothesis that treatment status, conditional on the other independent variables, is unrelated to attrition. The respective p-values of the coefficient of treatment status equals 0.918, 0.457 and 0.315 for UP, OP and NP households. This confirms that the absence of attrition bias at the household level, reported in<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandiera et al. (2017)</ref>, also applies to our sample of under-fives.</p></note>

Three rounds of data were collected: baseline (April-June 2017), round 2 (May-July 2018), and round 3 (June-August 2019). We used a split sample approach for modules on violence victimization and perpetration for male and female participants based on best practices guidance, in which male participants answered the violence module in one community and female participants in another, to protect confidentiality of participants and reduce the chance that a perpetrator-victim pair would both be interviewed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> We provided anonymized referral information to respondents containing contact numbers for district social welfare officers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Interviews were conducted in Swahili with same-sex enumerators in private settings and data were entered into SurveyBe version 5.10.210 (EDI Global Limited, Gerrards Cross, UK) software via tablets.</p></div>

Binary violence indicators for emotional, physical, and sexual violence were created from multiple items per violence type (Appendix E, available as a supplement to the online version of this article at <ref type="url" target="http://www.ajph.org">http://www.ajph.org</ref>). At baseline, because of an error in a dataentry skip pattern, sexual violence questions were only asked of individuals who reported ever having had sex.</p><p xml:id="_Hd6JzKW">In subsequent rounds, sexual violence questions were asked to all individuals selected for the violence module.</p><p xml:id="_892RVX7">Respondents experiencing any type of violence were then asked whether they had ever tried to seek help or tell anyone about the violence. In line with existing literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> we further categorized help seeking into formal and informal sources (Appendix E). Age-disparate sexual relationship was defined as having a sexual partner 5 or more years older, in line with previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Self-perceived stress was measured using the Enhanced Life Distress Inventory, which measures distress across multiple areas of social life and functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> and results in an overall scale ranging from 0 to 39 and 3 subscales (economic and healthrelated well-being, risk and security, relationships).

Among the panel sample interviewed at all 3 rounds (n 5 904), no adolescents had missing values for variables of interest.

Among the cited studies, there is variation in program components, implementing agencies, and dosage of exposure to components. It is difficult to make conclusions about which combinations are most effective in reducing VAC because few studies have tested different combinations of components, and there have been limited examples of the same program being implemented in multiple contexts. In our own study, we were unable to distinguish impacts of the individual intervention components because we could not vary program components across villages.</p><p xml:id="_xTNTXTe">Studies that have evaluated impacts of cash transfers (in contrast with our study, which only evaluated the "plus" components in cash plus) have found positive impacts on school attendance, <ref type="bibr">45,</ref><ref type="bibr">46</ref> reductions in intimate partner violence among adolescents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> and reductions in other violence-related outcomes among children and adolescents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> These studies are not in contrast with our findings, because the interventions studied were different (cash transfers vs "plus" components).</p><p xml:id="_zEsBs3D">Other studies examining effects of cash plus programs have found that these reduced violence against adolescents and youths, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> as well as harsh discipline or corporal punishment among young children. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">47,</ref><ref type="bibr">48</ref> Limitations Generalizability of the results to all adolescents in Tanzania is limited. In</p><p xml:id="_xqethNP">addition, the productive grant was disbursed shortly before round 3, and, thus, full impacts of the intervention may not have fully materialized. During round 3 fieldwork, households experienced a delay in PSSN payments for the first time, and this may have mitigated impacts of the cash plus program. Underreporting of violence is not expected to be correlated with treatment status and therefore should not bias impact estimates. Perpetration of physical and emotional violence was not assessed at baseline so we could not assess balance between intervention arms before program roll-out. Our study design did not allow us to disentangle effects of the different program components, and, thus, we could not conclude which components may have contributed more to violence reduction. Finally, it is possible that our subanalyses were subject to type II errors, as power is reduced as sample sizes are reduced, and ability to make conclusions about heterogeneous treatment effects is limited. A key factor in the successful implementation of this intervention was multisectoral coordination, including at the district level, where staff were based and activities were implemented. While most program components were administered through PSSN structures, health facilities strengthening was carried out by Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly, and Children, with technical support from UNICEF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_79CDeA5">Conclusions</head><p xml:id="_myab8yr">Multisectoral approaches are increasingly advocated to address the drivers of violence. Our study showed that a government-run, multisectoral cash plus intervention reduced violence experiences and perpetration. The broad potential reach of similar scalable interventions has implications for VAC reduction at the population level.</p></div>

Randomization Random assignment of 130 villages into study arms (65 intervention and 65 control) was conducted in July 2017, after completion of the baseline surveys, and was stratified by TASAF administrative areas (program administrative areas, corresponding to Mafinga and Mufindi districts in Iringa, and Rungwe and Busokelo districts in Mbeya) and village size (large vs small villages).</figDesc></figure>

Guiding principles included government ownership, implementation within the PSSN livelihoods enhancement strategy and existing government frameworks, linkages with other government services, and age-and gender-sensitive livelihoods interventions. The intervention comprised (1) faceto-face livelihoods and life skills training delivered 2 hours per week over 12 weeks (January-May 2018); (2) mentoring (occurring biweekly and then monthly between July 2018 and March 2019) and a productive grant (totaling US $80 disbursed in up to 2 payments between March and June 2019), conditional on having attended trainings and developing an approved educational or business plan; and (3) facilitated linkages to adolescent-friendly HIV and sexual and reproductive health services in government health facilities (July 2018-March 2019; Appendix C, available as a supplement to the online version of this article at http://www.ajph. org). The training included sessions on livelihoods, sexual and reproductive health, and HIV prevention and treatment, including a bundle of high-impact behavior change communication approaches and peer support groups (topics summarized in Appendix C). During mentoring, adolescents were provided with linkages to training and apprenticeship activities, input on business plans, peer education, and linkages to health facilities (Activities in Appendix D, available as a supplement to the online version of this article at http://www.ajph.org). Two mentors (1 male, 1 female) were selected per village. Addressing supply of health services, UNICEF worked with the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly, and Children to perform a training in July 2019 with staff at government primary health care facilities in treatment villages to strengthen adolescent-friendly services.</figDesc></figure>

We adjusted the regression models for age, sex, and stratum (district and village size), and we adjusted standard errors for clustering and heteroskedasticity by using the VCE (robust) command in Stata version 16 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). We further calculated average-treatment-on-the-treated estimates by using 2-stage least squares regressions with linear probability models, in which we predicted program take up in the first-stage regressions and treatment impacts on the treated in the second stage. We tested program impacts on potential pathways of impact at rounds 2 and 3, and then tested pathway impacts by gender at round 3 only.

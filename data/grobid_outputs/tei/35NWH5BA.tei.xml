<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_XdabHaP"><p xml:id="_rKNbuaG">This article attempts to provide an understanding to what extent institutional change of the functional activities of microfinance influences some specific health-related outcomes for the ultra-poor people in Bangladesh. It examines impact of the 'Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction-Targeting the Ultra Poor' (CFPR-TUP) programme on health-related outcomes using a large balanced panel data set (2002, 2005 and 2008)  from rural areas of Bangladesh. The main objective of this article is to examine both short-and long-term impacts on health-related issues of the ultra poor using both conditional and unconditional difference-in-differences (DID). In particular, this article examines the distinction between treatment and control groups in base year and the year followed up as well as the impact on coping ability. This study finds the significant impact of the programme on investment in health and awareness indicator such as usage of sanitation though we are suspicious about its sustainability. The programme therefore has sustainable impact on health investment and to some extent, on coping ability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Nen6vte">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_q2BuVss">Of the many targeted programmes for the ultra poor in Bangladesh, Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee's (BRAC) 'Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction-Targeting the Ultra Poor' (CFPR-TUP or TUP henceforth) has some distinct characteristics as it has combined its methodology for its beneficiary selection from prior field experiences and empirical research and provides not only income generating assets (IGAs), but also other complements such as stipend to reduce opportunity cost, training, healthcare and support from local elites. A growing number of past studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmed, Rabbani, Sulaiman &amp; Das, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Das &amp; Misha, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rabbani, Prakash &amp; Sulaiman, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Raza, Das &amp; Misha, 2012)</ref> have examined impact of the TUP but not much is known about the impact on health issues. Existing studies have so far also neglected the long-term impact of this programme in detail, especially on health-related issues. This article addresses these gaps using a large panel data set collected by BRAC's Research and Evaluation Division (BRAC-RED) in three rounds <ref type="bibr">(2002, 2005 and 2008)</ref>. Targeting the Ultra Poor programme provides IGAs and healthcare to the ultra-poor households to increase their capital stock and thus the return. It then encourages investing more in health to increase income, which in turn help the ultra poor to exit poverty in a sustainable way. Thus, the TUP programme has potential sustainable impact on health of the ultra poor as it channels its inputs to these desired outputs.</p><p xml:id="_9tp2Tjd">Health is one of the key components of human assets as importance of health is evidenced in human capital, human development and also in the millennium development goals (MDGs). This is why people place a high value and concentration on health. Generally, a healthier person is capable of producing more which is reflected in the labour market rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bardhan &amp; Udry, 1999)</ref>. This implies improvement in health increases a person's productivity and thus the income and ultimately establishes a very strong association between income and well-being. However, there is a joint causation between income and investment in health and this generates an intergenerational 'poverty trap' for the ultra poor as they are unable to invest in health, and thus earn low incomes and remain chronically poor. Therefore, the joint causation of human capital investment and income provides a theory of the distribution of income <ref type="bibr">(ibid., 1999)</ref>. Thus, the improved health status plays a key role in helping the ultra poor to exit poverty in a sustainable manner. This article not only looks to what extent the fundamental endowmenthealthcare-helps ultra poor in a sustainable manner but also how it helps to cope with shocks. As existing studies on impact assessment of the TUP have neglected the coping ability of the ultra poor, this article also addresses this gap with caution.</p><p xml:id="_Ju7CmKR">Livelihood outcome of the ultra poor like health is shaped by their vulnerability to idiosyncratic and covariate shocks. This study defines shocks as unpredictable external or crisis events that may weaken economic status of the ultra poor, which in turn, worsen their well-being. Distressed sale of land and large outof-pocket expenditure are frequently found in ultra-poor households for facing such crises as traditional reciprocity-based risk-coping mechanisms are getting weaker. Coping ability of the ultra poor therefore needs to be addressed for policy implications. Generally, more capable households spend more to recover from shocks. This article uses two indicators for measuring coping ability: spending behind shocks and time to recover. More spending and earlier recovery from shocks implies more capability of the ultra poor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ellis (2000)</ref> asserts that crises, risks and vulnerabilities are interlinked concepts. <ref type="bibr">Morduch (1990)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kochar (1995)</ref> asserts that inter-households differences in vulnerability to shocks are strongly associated with differences in access to credit. As TUP is recognized as 'ladder to microfinance', it is important to look at the impact of the TUP on coping ability of the ultra poor. This study argues TUP has a sustainable impact on health and coping ability. I attribute this to TUP as it enables ultra poor to smooth such shocks through cash transfers and continuous support from local elite and BRAC at the time of natural devastations. Thus, enhanced coping ability to smooth impact directly reduces the need to resort to the ex post sale or depletion of assets or to costly ex ante measures in order to buffer income from shocks.</p><p xml:id="_mcamgWy">As there is no universally accepted definition for the ultra poor, different studies use their own concepts and approaches. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lipton (1983)</ref> first used the term 'ultra poor' to mean those who spend 80 per cent of their total expenditure on food and cannot attain 80 per cent of standard calories required. World <ref type="bibr">Bank (1996)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Halder and Mosley (2004)</ref> defines ultra poor as those who have no own land or house, no other income sources except manual labour, no savings, no capacity to have three meals a day, no affordability to have minimum clothing and to invest in human capital. A further study by the World Bank (1998) subdivides the extreme poor as the destitute and the ultra poor based on kilocalorie consumption per person per day. While the first category, the destitute, consumes less than 1,600 kcal and are unable to fit for any development intervention, the second category, the ultra poor, consume less than 1,805 kcal but more than 1,600 kcal and are physically fit for work. This study uses Bangladesh's Household Income &amp; Expenditure Survey (HIES) data set and finds that out of 36 per cent extreme poor, ultra poor and destitute comprise 31 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rahman and Razzaque (2000)</ref> have incorporated multidimensionality for addressing the ultra poor such as income, occupation, housing, physical assets, geography, sex of the household head and dependency ratio. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sen and Begum (1998)</ref> focused more on the three important indicators such as land, housing and occupation for identification of the ultra poor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Khandker and Chowdhury (1996)</ref> use the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) standard of 2,112 kcal per person per day and identify the extreme poor based on consumption which is Tk. 5,270 per person per year. Therefore, there are distinctive characteristics and causes of being ultra poor, who find it considerably difficult to move out of ultra poverty and is usually excluded because of their asset base or irresponsive to the traditional anti-poverty interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Marsden, 2010)</ref>. This study follows World Bank's definition of extreme poverty in 1998. Key characteristics of the ultra poor in Bangladesh are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_kz5r89d">Though poverty reduction rate is somewhat impressive in Bangladesh over the last few decades, ultra-poverty situation remains at around 25 per cent in 2005. The upper and lower poverty lines use the cost of basic needs (CBN) that makes clear-cut distinction between the moderate and extreme poor. While the proportion of population below the upper poverty line declined by 18 percentage points between 2000 and 2005, the rate of decline in extreme poverty for the same time period was 27 percentage points <ref type="bibr">(HIES, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr">(HIES, , 2005))</ref>. Nevertheless, the ultra-poor issue remains a key challenge in Bangladesh as the overall incidence of ultra poverty persists at a high level. The incidence of ultra poverty is almost twice in rural than in the urban and thus this study considers rural ultra poverty. Poverty dynamics in Bangladesh is clearly presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Source: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Matin, Sulaiman and Rabbani (2008)</ref>. Source: <ref type="bibr">HIES (1991</ref><ref type="bibr">HIES ( /92, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr">HIES ( /96, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr">HIES ( , 2005))</ref>. Note: Different rounds of HIES. Calculation used upper and lower poverty lines of 2005 adjusting price changes between years.</p><p xml:id="_WDjPKAT">Certain exclusion and inclusion criteria must be met to be selected as a TUP programme beneficiary. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that exclusionary conditions are stricter than those of inclusions as all exclusion conditions must be met where at least three inclusion conditions should be fulfilled by the households in order to be selected as a beneficiary. Households that meet both exclusion and inclusion criteria come under TUP and receive components.</p><p xml:id="_2sZhwNF">This study uses a large panel data set from Bangladesh, spanning about 6 years, to examine the impact of the TUP on health-related issues of the ultra poor. This panel data set maintains a control group since base year (2002) and thus it is not required to construct an artificial counterfactual. We strongly assume the validity of parallel trend assumption based on literature and homogeneity in nature of poverty. As longitudinal micro-data sets look intensely into factors at individuals and households that contribute to design appropriate policies, this rationale interested me working with such data set collected by BRAC-RED from ultra-poor households in rural Bangladesh to explore impact and its sustainability. This study explores impact of the TUP on health aspects and coping ability both for short and long term.</p><p xml:id="_sy6bdu6">Analytical framework using TUP programme theory is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, which indicates the flow of key issues relating to impact assessment. Households under TUP receive inputs such as IGAs, enterprise development training, cash, healthcare, mobilization and local elite's support. These inputs are used in TUP's production process and the resultant outputs are indicated by the overall impact on increase in asset and asset's return, consumption smoothing, reducing vulnerabilities and morbidity and also rising awareness. All these together strengthen the coping ability of the programme beneficiaries. This study would cover the impact on health-related issues and in particular, the coping ability of the ultra-poor households. The overall simplified programme theory is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_JTprPCD">The main objective of this article is to assess the impact of the TUP on health-related aspects of the ultra-poor households in Bangladesh. In this pursuit, this study attempts to observe the possible impact on those outcomes answering the question: What are the TUP impacts on health-related issues? In particular, this study looks to what extent selected ultra poor (SUP or the treatment) differs in those issues from non-selected ultra poor (NSUP or the control) in the base year and the year followed up and also to what extent the TUP helps the beneficiaries to cope with shocks, that is, coping ability. 4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_yu3FrEV">Materials and Methods</head><p xml:id="_Y9gyn6z">The setting for the analysis is Bangladesh. The longitudinal data on which this study is based build on the three wave surveys <ref type="bibr">(2002, 2005 and 2008)</ref> conducted by BRAC-RED to evaluate short-and longterm impact of the TUP on health-related issues and in particular, the coping ability of ultra poor. Data collection methodologies are well described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Shams, Mahmud and Das (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Das and Misha (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rabbani et al. (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Matin (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Matin and Halder (2004)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_pf7gP4z">The reform in microfinance itself has a long history. The latest innovative approach (inclusive microfinance), undertaken by BRAC in 2002 with the assistance from donor consortium, is likely to impact the livelihoods of ultra poor. This raises issue to adopt proper methodology for measuring impact of the TUP on health-related issues and coping ability of the ultra poor in a sustainable manner. Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee's TUP aims explicitly at reducing vulnerabilities and improving socioeconomic and political asset base through promotional and protective approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Matin &amp; Halder, 2004)</ref>. As different studies indicate programmes targeted at the ultra poor in Bangladesh suffer severe shortcomings in the selection process and distribution of assets, targeting approach and beneficiary selection process should be fair and effective. For introducing TUP in all the sub-districts of the three northern districts of Bangladesh (namely, Rangpur, Nilphamari and Kurigram), BRAC has combined various targeting methodologies and knowledge streams for fair and effective targeting. Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee has used its extensive network of regional offices at the district level, area offices (AO) and branch offices (BO) at the sub-district (Upazila) level and below for selecting the ultra poor. Local knowledge from AO level is used to draw a list of clusters within their working area, where non-governmental organization (NGO) operations are relatively low and poorer households are clustered. A team consisting of TUP Programme Officer (POs) have visited these clusters, built up rapport and arrived at a final list of clusters called 'spots' or participatory wealth rank (PWR) spots located in the villages. For the PWR exercise, the maximum size of such a PWR exercise is deemed not to exceed 150, which is a natural limit to the size of each spot (ibid.). The clusters which are predominantly inhabited by better-off people are possibly excluded. Once the PWR is done, a survey is administered in bottom-most two wealth categories. The collected information from this survey is tailored with TUP's exclusion and inclusion criteria in order to prepare a preliminary list for potential beneficiaries, which is cross-checked by a team of managers at the different levels by visiting the potential beneficiary households to arrive at a final section.</p><p xml:id="_rQfqMqw">Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee's Research and Evaluation Division carried out a baseline survey for the TUP from June to August 2002 as a part of its evaluation plan. The survey included both the programme and control households from 27 villages located in 3 out of Bangladesh's 64 districts. The programme SUP through PWR, where households living in the poorest category were considered as ultra poor though sometimes the poorest two categories were considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Das &amp; Misha, 2010)</ref>. Among these ultra poor, those were finally selected for the TUP known as SUP or treatment and those were excluded were the NSUP or the control. The NSUP households were also surveyed to represent the control group for the TUP. Though both categories were recognized as ultra poor by the PWR, NSUPs were excluded from having benefits from the programme as they are relatively better off. The effectiveness of selection of the treatment and control through PWR is evidenced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sulaiman and Matin (2006)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_XPYTeeh">In baseline survey, the sample size was 5,626 households of which 2,633 were treatment and 2,993 were control. The survey questionnaire was administered to the woman or the wife of the household head. In 2005, RED re-surveyed a total of 5,228 households of the 5,626 households surveyed in 2002 to construct the 2002-2005 panel. The 2005 follow-up survey included 2,474 treatment and 2,754 control households. The overall attrition is 6 per cent where it is 7.98 per cent for control and 6.04 per cent for treatment. Whether impacts are sustainable or not, RED re-surveyed a total of 4,549 households of which 2,251 were treatment and 2,298 were control households. The attrition rates were 16.56 per cent and 9.01 per cent for control and treatment groups, respectively. The overall attrition <ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2004)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2005)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref> is about 20 per cent, which is high. However, attrition is not biased as we still find significant differences in the outcome variables in the base year between the treatment and control groups, which are also evidenced in the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmed et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rabbani et al., 2006)</ref>. Thus, the attrition or drop out from the sample is random. This study uses the balanced panel of 4,549 households of which 2,251 are treatment and 2,298 are control. It is necessary to compare outcomes for beneficiaries with the outcomes of nonbeneficiaries for measuring impact. This requires controlling for the effects of economic and contextual factors that make programme beneficiaries systematically different from non-beneficiaries. These factors might include household characteristics (e.g., demographics, skill levels or social networks) that affect the programme impact. Studies that imperfectly control for these characteristics suffer from 'selection biases'. As the programme selection was done based on the household characteristics, this study controls only those characteristics and then looks at to what extent the TUP contributes to health-related issues and eventually, the coping ability of the ultra poor. For assessing the impact, this study uses differencein-differences (DID) with or without controlling the contextual factors to observe the sensitivity of the impact estimates for desired outcomes.</p><p xml:id="_eC9U7cK">As TUP continues its assistance up to 2 years, it is very much relevant to observe the impact both for short and long term. Here, 'short term' refers to just before and end of the programme <ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2004)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2005)</ref> and 'long term' refers to after 3 years from end of the programme <ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2004)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2005)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref>. Long term is used to see the sustainability of the impact on the desired outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ytGVZ2S">Results and Discussion</head><p xml:id="_UVfUBMS">The analysis section starts with focusing the dynamics of the basic characteristics of the ultra-poor households using the full sample of the study (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Halder and Mosley (2004)</ref> show that the average household size tends to be smaller in poor households, which is evidenced in our study. The average household size is 3.78, which is smaller than the national average 4.85 <ref type="bibr">(HIES, 2005)</ref>. However, our findings reflect an upward trend for average family size. Household heads are around 43 years in baseline. Household heads also had very little schoolingaverage schooling attainment was 0.57 years. Female-headed households are very common in poorer households, which is evidenced in our findings and justified by inclusion and exclusion criteria of the TUP that more than 30 per cent of the ultra poor households are female-headed. The prevalence of widowed, divorced and separated household heads is worth mentioning that only 70 per cent of the household heads are married and others fall into those categories. Years of schooling and literacy status of the household heads remain almost constant over time.</p><p xml:id="_KNUXYJC">As illness depletes human capital and inability to work depletes assets further, it is thus important to look at health-related issues of the ultra poor. The prevalence of sickness (from last 15 days recall) shows that 14.4 per cent of people suffered from illness in 2002. This rose to 16.1 per cent in 2005 and decreased to 13 per cent in 2008. Thus, less morbidity is found in 2008 compared to 2002. The same evidence is found for severe illness. Disability prevalence is higher among the ultra poor in Bangladesh and this is supported by our findings that about 2 per cent of the ultra poor are disabled. Proportion of households stopping work has an increasing trend over the years. This study finds people ill for shorter time period lose, on average, 3 working days in 2002, which rose to 3.8 and 6.1 in 2005 and 2008, respectively. This lends support to the hypothesis that increase in number of work days lost reflects the greater ability of the ultra poor to take time off to recover rather than attempt to keep working <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Rabbani et al., 2006)</ref>. Increasing trend in doctor's fee and medicine cost implies larger invest in health and also greater coping ability of the ultra. A large improvement is found for the usage of sanitation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_fBhw74Y">Coping Ability</head><p xml:id="_bxddZfe">This study uses the term 'coping ability' referring to the power or capacity of the ultra poor to recover from crises. As TUP aims to strengthen capability of the ultra poor, this study measures impact of the TUP on coping ability, which uses two proxies to measure: one is the amount of money spent for crisis and the other, time to recover. The higher the amount spent for crisis, the higher the coping ability. On the contrary, the shorter the time required to recover from crisis, the higher the capability of the ultra poor. This study assumes positive association between coping ability and the amount spent for crisis and negative association of time to recover and coping ability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Quisumbing (2011)</ref> defines shocks as adverse events that lead to households' income loss, consumption reduction, a loss of productive assets and well-being. Data used in this study are based on a household-level 'shocks' during the time covered in this study, which considers economic, political/social/legal, crime, health and life-cycle shocks. This study considers shocks as crises events because of high costs for recovery, which fall them into the trap of poverty. The prevalence of shocks at the ultra-poor household level is summarized in Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.1, which shows that the most frequently reported shock is house damages (40.2 per cent), food-related problem (52.6 per cent) and severe illness (24.7 per cent) in 2002. However, all these show downward trends implying greater well-being and less shock burden on ultra poor in later years. Among others, high expenses for ceremonies, death of earning or nonearning member, death of livestock, conflict of legal cases and theft or robbery are the frequent shocks reported by them. In 2005, questionnaire was modified on specific issues in order to include illness and death-related shocks of dairy and poultry and also death of an earning or non-earning member. In addition, amount of expenses associated with crisis was collected in 2005 and 2008. Data on time to recover from crisis were collected only in 2005 for observing the coping ability.</p><p xml:id="_4Q5E7Ph">Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> represents average expenses associated with shocks. The average expense incurred for shock is Tk. 2,233 in 2005 and Tk. 4,208 in 2008. Among the reported shocks, the highest average expense is found for ceremonies such as getting married, which is Tk. 10,191. This is due to the higher charge of dowry or other related expenses. The second and third largest expense categories are death of earning member and conflict of legal cases.</p><p xml:id="_bHDnuz9">Recovery from shock within the short time implies the higher coping capability of the ultra poor. In order to measure the coping ability, BRAC-RED collected information by modifying questionnaire in 2005. Self-reported time to recover from crisis is used in this study for analysis. While the three shocks such as ceremonies, conflict or legal case and death of livestock take the highest time to recover from crisis, the lowest time for recovery is found for food crisis. All are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_EAzvjK9">This study focuses to what extent TUP contributes to health-related issues. A recall method for last 15 days was used to see the prevalence of sickness in the ultra-poor people. More than 14 per cent of them suffer from at least one kind of sicknesses. The sickness prevalence for the two groups is measured using first difference and this study finds no significant impact of the programme on morbidity issues. However, it finds a significant long-term impact for stop working due to illness though average work days lost is no longer significant. This implies more ability of the treatment group in 2008. We also find the treatment group invests, on average, more in health compared to the control, which are evidenced from our estimates that higher proportion of people of the treatment group spends on doctor's fee and medicine and transportation. It is also evidenced from the amount they spend for health. The TUP has wider impact on usage of sanitation though we have a negative impact in 2008 over 2005, which means long-term impact is smaller than the short-term impact.

The impact estimates regarding health issues from the unconditional DID are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_gnVRg48">The impact of the TUP on health-related issues using conditional DID estimate is almost the same as unconditional approach. Conditional DID measures the impact after controlling the covariates of the household characteristics such as size of the household, age, sex, marital status, education, literacy of the household head, no. of earning member and savings.</p><p xml:id="_pYS2qBg">Unconditional DID estimates on health-related issues prove that the TUP has a very little impact on reducing the illness. However, it has an impact on investment in health, which will benefit them in the future. To check for robustness, we have estimated conditional DID on some specific issues. We find TUP has a significant impact on reducing severe illness in the short term. Findings in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref> show that the TUP has no impact on drinking tube well water, but it has a significant impact on the usage of sanitation both in the short and long term. However, the impact in 2008 over 2005 is negative, which implies that long-term impact is smaller than the short-term impact. Though the magnitudes of the conditional estimates for usage of sanitation are smaller than the estimates from unconditional estimates, the magnitudes, sign and significance remain the same for the impact in 2008 over 2005. Therefore, after the end of the programme, the trend of the impact starts declining.</p><p xml:id="_jQSfdUk">TUP impact on coping ability is measured using unconditional DID. Amount of money spent for facing crises is used as a surrogate for measuring coping ability. The reported figures consider only those households that experienced shock. The more expense implies more capability of the ultra poor and thus, the more impact of the TUP. Unconditional DID estimates on expense are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref>, which shows the significant impact on coping ability only for two cases, for example, ceremonies and severe illness. As the TUP works for enhancing the capability of the ultra poor, it is evidenced from our findings that the beneficiary could spend more in the face of crises. More coping ability is also evidenced from high investment in health in case of severe illness.</p><p xml:id="_VeKA8qt">First difference is used to see whether any significant difference exists between the treatment and control (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref>). Earlier recovery from shocks implies higher coping capability of the ultra poor. A positive sign in first difference implies the beneficiary takes more time to recovery compared to nonbeneficiary. This study finds significant difference between the groups for ceremonies, theft or robbery and death of an earning member. Though the sign is negative for ceremonies, it is positive for theft and  death of an earning member. Thus, the treatment group is more vulnerable to theft and death of an earning member as the treatment group takes significantly longer time to recover compared to control. However, a negative sign for ceremonies implies that the treatment group needs significantly less time to recover from such shock as compared to the control. We might guess TUP plays the role to coping ability of the ultra poor for house damages, severe illness, conflict and non-earning member's death as the signs are negative for those. Sometimes, sign of the coefficients, not the significance, plays an important role for policy implication. A growing number of past studies have examined the impact on poverty of TUP programme but not much is known about the channels that link the programme inputs and poverty impacts. Existing studies have so far also neglected the long-term impact of this programme, especially on landholdings, health and distribution of income by quintile. This article addresses these two gaps using a unique set of balanced panel data collected by BRAC-RED in three rounds <ref type="bibr">(2002, 2005 and 2008)</ref>. The main objective of this article is to examine short-and long-term impacts of the TUP on landholdings, health and income of the ultra-poor households in rural Bangladesh using conditional and unconditional DID methods. In addition, fixed effects estimation is also applied to check the robustness of the estimates on certain outcomes such as total land owned, access to land, land-man ratio, chronic food deficit, income and its distribution. Conditional DID measures the true impact of the TUP on those outcomes after controlling the household characteristics. Though we have estimated two short-term impacts <ref type="bibr">(2005 over 2002 and 2008 over 2005)</ref> and one long-term impact <ref type="bibr">(2008 over 2002)</ref>, this article concentrates on short-term impact <ref type="bibr">(2005 over 2002)</ref> and long-term impact to a great extent. Additional short-term impact <ref type="bibr">(2008 over 2005)</ref> provides intuition about whether long-term impact is greater than short-term impact <ref type="bibr">(2005 over 2002)</ref>, the further issue of sustainability. This would also help to provide trend of the impacts. In particular, this article examines the distinction between treatment and control groups in the base year and the impact of the TUP on coping ability, which is measured in terms of expenses and time to recover from shocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Sd4xGpM">Conclusion</head><p xml:id="_uQxTrVh">No significant impact of the programme is found for morbidity both in the short and long term after using both conditional and unconditional DID. Significant long-term impact is found only for stop working due to illness, which is justified by more ability of the treatment group. As it is evidenced from the literature review that rich people invest more in health, our findings are also supportive to the existing literature as the treatment group invests more in health compared to control. Thus, the TUP has a positive significant impact on investment in health, which is measured in terms of proportion of people spend on doctor's fee and medicine and transportation costs. It is also evidenced from the proportion of households who spent for health-related crisis and also from the amount spent for those crises. Targeting the Ultra Poor also has wider impacts on consciousness indicator such as usage of sanitation though we have a negative impact in 2008 over 2005. This is also evidenced by conditional DID. However, we have estimated conditional DID on some specific issues to check for robustness. In case of severe illness, we find a significant impact of the TUP, which implies that prevalence of severe illness of the beneficiaries significantly declines compared to the control.</p><p xml:id="_Em7NJfW">This study measures coping ability using unconditional DID. Amount of money spent for crisis is used as a surrogate for measuring coping ability. More expense implies more coping ability of the ultra poor. This study finds the significant impact of the TUP on ceremonies and severe illness, on which the treatment group spends more compared to the control. These are also evidenced from the coping ability measured by time to recover from crisis event. This study finds that the treatment group needs significantly less time to recover from high expense for ceremonies. Even the TUP plays the role to coping ability for house damages, severe illness and conflict as treatment takes less time, on average, to recover from such shocks compared to the control.</p></div>

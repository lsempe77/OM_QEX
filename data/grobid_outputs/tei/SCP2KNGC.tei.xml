<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ErksWF5">Motivation</head><p xml:id="_KrQB3mh">• In recent years, a growing literature in development economics has examined the multifaceted constraints faced by households in extreme poverty.</p><p xml:id="_q3TWjak">• Given the salience of these multiple constraints, multifaceted "graduation model" interventions that simultaneously address several barriers are widely viewed as promising -and higher-quality evidence is growing.</p><p xml:id="_MAexGfs">• However, the effectiveness of these interventions when implemented at large scale has not been widely explored to date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_aCmDes8">SPIR (Strengthen PSNP Institutions and Resilience)</head><p xml:id="_RFqhskF">• In this talk, I will present new evidence from a randomized trial of a lighter-touch graduation model implemented at scale in rural Ethiopia, during the first phase of SPIR.</p><p xml:id="_DHryxu7">• SPIR targets households who are beneficiaries of the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), and thus are among the poorest 20% of rural Ethiopian households.</p><p xml:id="_5ffq8yR">• The core set of interventions includes $200 lump sum transfer for the poorest households; membership in village-level savings associations; and training in new productive value chains. SPIR graduation model: Light-touch, large-scale • SPIR is lighter-touch than other similar interventions • For example, the graduation model interventions across six countries evaluated by Banerjee et al. (2015) encompass asset transfers of $600-$1000 in conjunction with cash transfers, training, savings' groups and household-level coaching.</p><p xml:id="_dYc9ZEG">• SPIR is delivered at large scale (150,000 households)</p><p xml:id="_9y2SXag">• This is larger than other projects analyzed to date, with the exception only of BRAC's Targeting the Ultrapoor program in Bangladesh analyzed by <ref type="bibr">Bandiera et al. (2017)</ref>, serving nearly 400,000 households.</p><p xml:id="_eQgamMh">The SPIR trial</p><p xml:id="_uMsXjZs">• We evaluate the effects of SPIR in a large randomized controlled trial.</p><p xml:id="_Rqcb8gS">• We focus on the main randomization dimensions around livelihoods, although the main trial included cross-randomized interventions focused on nutrition.</p><p xml:id="_E9efQaD">• The primary livelihoods intervention package is a $200 transfer (randomly assigned to be cash or poultry) in conjunction with training and establishment of savings groups.</p><p xml:id="_pgPBgMS">• A secondary, even lighter-touch package encompasses only training and savings groups.</p><p xml:id="_PyA4cvN">• The primary vs secondary packages were randomly assigned at the kebele level. Within "primary" kebeles, this package was targeted to the extreme poor (poorest 50%); less poor households received the secondary package.</p></div>

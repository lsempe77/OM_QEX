<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_YRMBvkx"><p xml:id="_U7aKNqN">We study the long-run effects of a big-push "graduation" program in Ethiopia in which very poor households received a one-time transfer of productive assets (mainly livestock), technical training, and access to savings accounts. After seven years, treatment effects on wealth and consumption remain economically meaningful but dissipated relative to the two-and three-year results. Treatment effects on other outcomes attenuated further. Based on absolute wellbeing (e.g., food security) not dropping, we argue that the treatment effect dissipation is driven primarily by improved living standards for control households, rather than losses of the previously accrued benefits for the treatment households.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_pbABKBP">I. Introduction</head><p xml:id="_d4NAWg2">A central hypothesis within development economics is that poverty traps can explain why some individuals remain poor. At sufficiently low levels of wealth, individuals face a limited set of occupations, thus limiting wealth accumulation potential and in turn keeping them in low steadystate incomes and wealth levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Galor and Zeira 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Banerjee and Newman 1993)</ref>. Critically however, this literature hypothesizes that the same individuals could achieve a higher steadystate income if given a one-time infusion of capital. This theory, coupled with empirical evidence suggesting high short-run returns to capital in low-income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Udry and Anagol 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">De Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Blattman et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2014)</ref>, has provided a basis for public policies that provide one-time capital transfers.</p><p xml:id="_unYJTAD">Consistent with this microeconomic theory and empirical results, several studies have found promising short-and medium-run evidence on the effectiveness of "graduation" programs at increasing the earnings and wealth of very low-income individuals in developing countries. In graduation programs, individuals receive a one-time transfer of productive assets (or cash to buy productive assets), coupled with training, consumption support, and improved access to savings; all together the aim is to push these individuals into a higher steady-state income. Randomized evaluations of graduation-style programs have found that a one-off transfer coupled with other initial support is sufficient to change the occupation individuals are engaged in, and cause a short-run increase in earnings and wealth <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bandiera et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banerjee et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bedoya et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brune et al. 2022)</ref>. The theory inherent in these programs-that a one-off "big push" is sufficient to bring about higher steady state incomes-has been broadly adopted by policymakers. As of 2020, over 20 million households across 75 countries received some program centered around a one-off transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andrews et al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_FwsRjpz">However, demonstrating the existence of poverty traps successfully overcome by these programs requires satisfying a more stringent set of criteria. In particular, if these programs push individuals over some critical threshold, we should expect to see the short-run gains of these programs persist, and moreover to see untreated households fail to clear the same threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balboni et al. 2022)</ref>. The available long-run evidence on graduation programs, while limited, is largely consistent with this hypothesis. In randomized evaluations of graduation programs in Bangladesh and India, treatment effects persist for at least seven and ten years, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bandiera et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Banerjee, Duflo, and Sharma 2021)</ref>. Showing that these programs lead to positive impacts over long time horizons across a broad variety of contexts is consistent with the hypothesis of the prevalence of poverty traps.</p><p xml:id="_Kwv7v8e">However, there are also theoretical reasons we might expect to see convergence in the longer run. If the threshold theory is right and a program fails to push individuals over a critical threshold, we should expect treated households to return to their pre-program equilibrium. Alternatively, if the constraints faced by the poor are not binding in the long-run, for example because individuals can borrow or save their way above a critical capital threshold, or because labor productivity in the occupations available to them is high, control households should eventually catch up to their treated peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Buera, Kaboski, and Shin 2015)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_YRV3Gqm">While the "graduation" model cited above from India and Bangladesh found persistent long-run treatment effects (ten years), similar programs elsewhere often do not find long-run changes. For example, a dissipation is observed in Uganda-cash transfers to young adults lead to income and wealth gains at two and four years, but the control group has caught up by year nine <ref type="bibr">(Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2020)</ref>. This contrasting result suggests additional value in further understanding the environments and program differences in which the impacts of capital transfer-centered program results are consistent with the presence of and escaping from a poverty trap.</p><p xml:id="_5SKGVXN">When the long-run results are strong, a clearer case can be made for a poverty trap model. But when treatment effects fade, there are two broad interpretations. Is the treatment effect dissipation due to "seepage" in which treatment households slowly lose some of the accrued benefits they had experienced? Or due to control households catch-up? Naturally, this interpretation challenge is the logical consequence of properly constructing a counterfactual that is not merely the "pre" data for an individual. But using "pre" data for an individual as the counterfactual falls prey to countless omitted variable and selection biases, rendering the causal argument weak at best. However, while the trend-within-treatment may or may not be causal, we argue that it is still informative to simply ask whether there was any rescission of the absolute gains previously accrued to treatment households, which would be consistent with a poverty trap that was not surmounted by the treatment. If the decay of the treatment effect is accompanied instead by absolute gains by control households, some simple fixed-cost or production function non-convexity poverty trap models appear less useful.</p><p xml:id="_P6M6Wc9">We analyze the long-run effectiveness of a graduation program in Ethiopia, replicating the analysis protocols of Banerjee, Duflo, and Sharma (henceforth "BDS", 2021), who study a similar program in West Bengal, India. Both of these sites were part of a pooled-analysis of sixcountry graduation pilots, whose initial two and three year results were reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banerjee et al (2015)</ref>. Each was a local adaptation of the NGO BRAC's graduation program.</p><p xml:id="_wD7JR9D">In BDS, very poor households received either cattle, goats, or business inputs, and other support. The authors find strong treatment effects on consumption, income and revenues, and wealth at 18 months, three years, seven years, and ten years, with the size of treatment effects increasing between years three and seven. These accumulated gains appear to be driven in part by income diversification. Specifically, the graduation program relaxed liquidity constraints by year seven and ten that enabled members in treated households to migrate to more profitable locations; while control households also engaged in migration, it was to closer, less profitable cities and for shorter durations.</p><p xml:id="_dkH7gZS">Our study consists of 925 individuals from the region of Tigray who were eligible for the Productive Safety Net Programme, Ethiopia's food-for-work program. Recruited subjects were enrolled in a lottery; winning households received a one-off transfer of either sheep and goats, oxen, bees, or inventory for petty trade, coupled with technical training and coaching, and were given access to local bank accounts (with the requirement that $270 must be saved before individuals could draw down their savings). The program yielded large and positive impacts on consumption, income and wealth after two and three years <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Banerjee et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_Ad6fzeC">Our core result is that while there continue to be positive treatment effects on household welfare seven years after the initial program, long-run impacts have faded relative to the impacts present in earlier waves, in contrast to the growing treatment effects observed in India by BDS.</p><p xml:id="_dfQb8wz">Two and three years after the initial transfer of assets, the graduation program led to large average increases in per capita consumption: treatment effects of 0.24 standard deviations at two years, 0.25 SDs at three years; and large increases in asset wealth: 0.95 SDs at both two and three years. Concurrently, we see large gains in the frequency with which individuals engage in livestock market transactions. Two years after the asset transfer, treated have bought an average of $74 more livestock in the last 12 months (relative to a control mean of $13-these and all other values are in 2021 USD Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms), and have sold $79 more livestock (relative to a control mean of $18). By year seven, treated households continue to have greater wealth and higher consumption, but the gap has closed meaningfully. The treatment effect on wealth has fallen to 0.43 SDs, and consumption to 0.17 SDs. The frequency of livestock transactions has also narrowed between the groups; in the seventh post-treatment year, treated households bought just $5 more livestock and sold $38 more.</p><p xml:id="_tbb46HB">Between years three and seven, control households caught up to treatment households in food security and livestock ownership, two domains where it is especially feasible to measure economic welfare in real terms. On our food security index, control households have improved by 0.71, 0.74 and 1.02 standard deviations in the two-, three-and seven-year surveys. For example, the share of control households reporting that all members get enough food everyday has risen from 34% at baseline to 83% at year seven. Similarly, we find (using a price index based on local goods, described in Appendix A) that livestock ownership among treated households has not declined, but rather held constant over time (from $2,308 at year two to $2,469 at year three to $2,449 at year seven); the fading treatment effects reflect livestock accumulation on the part of control households.</p><p xml:id="_k6C2XH5">Our results are thus consistent with the hypothesis that the graduation program accelerated treatment household consumption, income, and wealth growth, but not with the idea that it pushed households into an equilibrium they would have been unable to reach absent the program. Control households also experienced meaningful gains in living standards during the study period, engaged in many of the same economic behaviors (specifically livestock ownership and sales), and have closed the initial gap in earnings and wealth achieved by the program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Jp6kwe2">II. Experimental Design, Intervention and Data</head><p xml:id="_Nf49xyc">The study took place in ten tabias (wards that include three to four villages) in Tigray Region, Ethiopia. Subjects were recruited from the government's food-for-work program, the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP). In our study area, PSNP participants earn chickpeas, teff and cooking oil in exchange for manual labor (e.g. digging trenches and engaging in land rehabilitation).</p><p xml:id="_myKdTtq">A local Community Task Force identified 1,000 PSNP participants for the study, on the basis of their having below average landholdings, low levels of livestock, high dependency ratios, and limited external forms of income. Individuals also had to be capable of engaging in a physical activity, and not have an outstanding loan at any financial institution. After this initial screening, 925 individuals were contacted and deemed eligible. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> Treatment status was determined via public lottery; we have no known instances of noncompliance with study design. Appendix Table <ref type="table">A1</ref> shows balance across the two groups at baseline. It is consistent with successful randomization.</p><p xml:id="_47N5Jbt">The graduation program was implemented by Tigrigna NGO Relief Society of Tigray (REST), a large and well-known NGO in the region that offers a variety of services, including water and sanitation, livelihoods programs and education programs.</p><p xml:id="_JjW8326">Treatment households were offered one of four productive asset options, each meant to be worth roughly $270 USD in value at the time ($1,371 2021 USD PPP): (1) 16 sheep or goats for fattening, (2) two oxen for fattening, (3) two beehives and colonies, and (4) a comparable value of inputs for petty trade. Most households chose some type of livestock: 62% chose shoats, 24% chose oxen, 10% beekeeping, and 4% petty trade. Each of the asset choices was accompanied by a specific technical training specific to their asset.</p><p xml:id="_muvbe87">Households additionally received a bank account at the Dedebit Credit and Savings Institution (a microfinance institution) in the nearest market center. Individuals were required to accumulate savings equal to the value of the initial transfer prior to being able to withdraw their savings. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>REST staff visited the program individuals for coaching on a regular basis over two years (initially weekly, then monthly). REST also offered quarterly refresher trainings of the core income generating principles. Unlike in some program contexts, treated households did not receive additional short-term cash or food transfers beyond what was already available to them (and to control households) via the PSNP program. Program activities ran from May 2010 to May 2012.</p><p xml:id="_BVVkznt">The program evaluated in BDS is also a local adaptation of the graduation program, with many similar components. As in Ethiopia, the most commonly chosen asset was goats in India (chosen by 52% of households), followed by cows (30%) and inputs for non-farm microenterprises (11%). Individuals received weekly cash transfers of INR 90 ($10.03) for 13-40 weeks (depending on the asset chosen), received coaching on a regular basis, and were required to save INR 10 ($1.11) per week when meeting with the implementing staff.</p><p xml:id="_mgkzeBK">The research NGO Innovations for Poverty Action conducted four waves of surveys. The baseline survey took place two months prior to the lottery. Follow-up surveys took place at the two-, three-, and seven-year marks. In each, we administered both a household survey, and up to two adult surveys. The household survey included household member characteristics, housing, assets, income, consumption, food security, health spending and shocks. The adult survey was administered to the household head (and their spouse, if married); questions included time use, control over decision-making, physical and mental health, and participation in political activities. A complete timeline of the program and surveying can be found in Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">A2</ref>. Attrition is low. Of the 925 sample households, we successfully interviewed 99% in our two-year survey, 98% in our three-year survey, and 96% in our seven-year survey. Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A3</ref> shows that attrition does not systematically differ between treatment and control households.</p></div>

(2015)</ref> and in BDS. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007)</ref> and create z-score indices for each family of outcomes. We standardize against the baseline whenever possible, or against the control group at year two (when any relevant variables were not collected at baseline). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> Additionally, we correct for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure to control for the false discovery rate (FDR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benjamini and Hochberg 1995)</ref>, following the procedure discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson (2008)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_yQmGTmG">Results are reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> for our three follow-up surveys conducted at the two-, three-and seven-year marks, reported in Columns (1), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and (3), respectively. To facilitate comparison with the results realized in India, we report the results from India at 1.5 years, three years, and seven years in Columns (4), (5), and (6) (these results come directly from Table <ref type="table">1</ref> of BDS, and are inflated to be in 2021 USD PPP terms). Following BDS, we report outcomes on political and women's empowerment in Appendix Table <ref type="table">A4</ref>, because of space constraints. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref>Three key patterns emerge from Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_5ffsk2P">First, the evaluation took place during a period of meaningfully improving living standards for control households. Asset ownership among control households has improved by 1.16 standard deviations (SDs) at the seven-year mark relative to baseline, and similarly, food security has improved by 1.02 SDs. Relative to the two-year mark (the first year for which we have comparable data), real per capita consumption has increased by 0.49 SDs at the seven-year mark, and income and revenues by 1.25 SDs. These changes in control means suggest that the environment in which the program took place was not one in which households were stagnating in a low-level equilibrium, but rather an environment of solid economic growth. Indeed, from 2011-2017, GDP grew in Ethiopia at an average rate of 10% per year-leading to GDP per capita more than doubling (117% increase) during the study period.</p><p xml:id="_7mm7UZv">Second, treatment effects on economic outcomes (wealth, consumption, food security, income and revenues, financial inclusion, productive time use) all follow a similar pattern: large and positive effects at years two and three, and with positive coefficients, albeit of reduced magnitude by year seven (and in many cases, a loss of statistical significance). For example, the estimated treatment effect on asset ownership has fallen from 0.95 SDs at years two and three to 0.43 SDs at year seven. Treatment effects on income and revenues and financial inclusion both exceeded 1 SD at their peak at year two (1.41 SDs in the case of income and revenues, 1.85 in the case of financial inclusion). By year seven, both point estimates are still moderately sized (0.24 and 0.30 SDs, respectively), but in neither case can we reject the null of no effect. Of note, because variance in our sample is growing over time, we are less powered to detect effects of a given size by the year seven mark.</p><p xml:id="_n9jHyXw">Our consumption estimates paint an intermediate picture: the decline from year three to year seven is relatively modest: 0.25 (p-value&lt;0.01) to 0.17 SDs (p-value=0.036). However, given the large number of families we are testing (and the lower rate of statistical significance across the ten families at year seven, leading to a greater false discovery rate adjustment), the adjusted qvalue on per capita consumption is 0.196 at year seven, suggesting ambiguity about the persistence of this effect.</p><p xml:id="_tThXVB3">Third, we observe very limited evidence of treatment effects on downstream outcomes. In no wave can we reject the null that the program had no effect on mental or physical health, or women's decision-making (the last of which is reported in Appendix Table <ref type="table">A4</ref>, given space constraints). This result stands in contrast to BDS, which finds at 1.5 and seven years that the program led to improved perceived physical and mental health.</p></div>

At year seven, control household per capita consumption is 33% higher than at the two-year mark (our measure at baseline is not directly comparable). The share of households getting enough food everyday has grown from 34% at baseline to 83% by year seven. Treatment effects are initially positive on both consumption and food security-by the three-year mark, per capita consumption is 18% among treatment households; food security has improved by 0.15 SDs. By the seven-year mark, consumption gains fade but persist (9% higher), but we can no longer reject that treatment effects are zero on our measures of food security.</p><p xml:id="_9R2xsaK">While these accumulated gains are sizable, treated households are still very poor by most standards. By the seven-year mark, control household per capita consumption is equal to $2.23 per day, and treatment consumption $2.43. Mean treatment household consumption has thus just exceeded the World Bank's extreme poverty threshold of $2.38 per day. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref>The treatment effects in India initially follow a similar initial trajectory to Ethiopia, with strong treatment effects in years two and three. In contrast, by year seven, consumption and food security treatment effects have grown in India. This divergence cannot be explained by the fact that control household living standards have improved in Ethiopia-in India, control households have also experienced large consumption growth, of 64% between baseline and year seven. In fact, BDS hypothesize that the initial positive program effects might have enabled treatment households to better take advantage of the strong macroeconomic conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_dZqb2dn">Income and Revenues</head><p xml:id="_d5sfxNy">The same pattern of divergence between Ethiopia and India is also present in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>, in which we examine income and revenues, (further disaggregated for Ethiopia in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</p><p xml:id="_Cw2gbhM">In Ethiopia, we observe strong and statistically significant treatment effects on income and revenues by years two and three, with results fading somewhat by year seven. On livestock revenues, we see extremely large effects at the two-year mark; treated individuals have $128 more per month (relative to a control mean of $32). This effect fades by years three and seven to $31 and $40 per month, respectively. At the seven-year mark, these declining results appear to be driven in part by control households increasing the extent to which they engage in livestock market transactions-their mean increases from $30 per month at year three to $90 per month at year seven. In India, treated households also experience gains in livestock revenues at the twoyear mark. Again, in contrast to Ethiopia, these treatment effects have increased by the sevenyear mark.</p><p xml:id="_SvbytJs">In both Ethiopia and India, treatment households diversify their income sources beyond the activities directly promoted by the program. In Ethiopia, this is primarily through increased agricultural activity. Net agricultural profits increase at years two and three (and there are positive point estimates at year seven, though we cannot reject the null of no effect). As shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, in all three follow-up waves the total household expenditure on agriculture increases, as does the land cultivated. In years two, three and seven, the acres cultivated by the household increases by 0.15, 0.22, and 0.25, respectively (representing 11%, 14%, and 18% increases). In years two and three, these increases translate to increases in agricultural revenue; by year seven we can no longer reject that treatment and control means are equal.</p><p xml:id="_NfrCMJh">In India, the degree of income diversification is more multifaceted. In addition to experiencing gains in livestock, the asset promoted by the program, treated households in India have increased income via fishing and horticulture, and via non-farm enterprise profits. Moreover, as in other outcomes, these treatment effects have increased from year three to year seven.</p><p xml:id="_b6DCASG">Another important difference between India and Ethiopia is the degree to which migration and remittances are an important and growing part of sample households' earnings portfolios. In neither country are there statistically significant differences between treatment and control households at the seven-year mark. However, in India, both treatment and control household remittances have grown substantially from years three to seven-control household remittances have grown by 171% in this time period. By year ten, there is a statistically significant difference (remittances are 52% higher). This effect is driven by household members spending more time away, being less likely to migrate to Kolkata (the nearest urban center) and earning more when they do migrate. BDS hypothesize that this was a key pathway to growing treatment effects in India. As the macroeconomic conditions improved, treatment households had more liquidity, and could thus finance more profitable migration spells.</p><p xml:id="_4SGXEBf">While we only observe effects through year seven in Ethiopia, we do not observe evidence suggesting a shift towards migration and remittances. Mean control group remittances grow from years two to three but are more or less constant between years three and seven (control mean of $9.06 per month at year three, $10.34 by year seven). Moreover, when we examine income channels further in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, we do not see evidence of growth on the extensive margin in households receiving any remittances (for treatment households, the share receiving any remittances at years three and seven are 16% and 18%, respectively, while for control households, the equivalent values are 24% and 14%, respectively).</p><p xml:id="_GswMMw3">One plausible difference between the two settings is the degree to which non-financial constraints to migration were binding. The study in Ethiopia took place during a period of political instability and ethnic tensions, which could have discouraged migration outside of Tigray, to parts of the country where the Tigrigna are an ethnic minority. Since 1991, a Tigrignadominated coalition had governed Ethiopia. Mass protests and government crackdowns outside of Tigray began in 2014 (year four), leading to the end of this government in 2018, a year after our seven-year survey. Consistent with this, we observe low rates of individuals leaving Tigray for another part of Ethiopia-just 1% by year three, and 5% by year seven. In fact, households were more likely to have a member who left Tigray for another country (8% and 9% at years three and seven, respectively) than for another region of Ethiopia. On neither of these margins do results differ by treatment status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_AUu8dc4">Cost-Benefit Analysis</head><p xml:id="_e9GNn63">While the benefits of the graduation program to treatment households were sizable, intervention costs are also substantial: in 2021 USD PPP terms, the total cost of the program was $4,011 per participant, reported in Panel A of Appendix Table <ref type="table">A5</ref>. Of this, $1,371 (34%) constituted a direct transfer to the household in the form of livestock or business inputs; the other two-thirds included a combination of implementing staff salaries, training, supervision costs, and indirect expenses. Notably, the expenditures were more than triple that of the per-person expenditures in India, though of the six sites reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banerjee et al. (2015)</ref>, Ethiopia is the third-cheapest. While in practice, some of the costs were incurred over the two years the training and coaching continued, we assume that all costs were incurred immediately at time zero when discounting.</p><p xml:id="_Bz6ZjbW">We calculate benefits on the basis of per capita consumption, reported in Panel B of Appendix Table <ref type="table">A5</ref>. In particular, we assume that the full benefit to households is equal to the sum of all consumption treatment effects. We make three key additional assumptions. First, we assume that the impacts on consumption at the one-year mark are equal to those at the two-year mark. Second, we assume that the decline in consumption treatment effects from year three to year seven followed a linear decline. Third, we assume that this linear rate of decline from year three to seven continued/continues, up to the final year at which treatment effects would be greater than zero under this decline (year 16, in 2026). We annualize these consumption benefits, and apply a 5% annual discount rate, following the social discount rate used by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (International Monetary Fund 2013). Our estimated benefits are restricted to consumption effects. We are therefore neglecting any insurance benefit associated with increased wealth (including via the directly transferred assets), nor are we incorporating any non-pecuniary benefits, for example, through feeling more politically empowered.</p><p xml:id="_HFeXaCM">Under these assumptions, we find that the total costs and total benefits are very similar-total benefits to the household equal 97% of costs. This result depends fundamentally on the fact that while program costs are incurred immediately, benefits are gradual and extend over a long-time horizon. In total (as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, and Panel C of Appendix Table <ref type="table">A5</ref>), with no discount rate applied, the total projected benefits are well in excess of program costs. Benefits are equal to costs at a social discount rate of 4.4%.</p><p xml:id="_XUWXpU6">We quantify the uncertainty of our benefit-cost ratio estimates using bootstrap simulations. For each of 10,000 repetitions, we construct a bootstrap sample, re-estimate consumption treatment effects on this sample, and calculate our benefit-cost ratio on these estimated values. (This procedure is further described in Appendix C). We find that benefits exceed costs in 52% of our simulations; our 95% confidence interval of the benefit cost-ratio is [0.42, 2.36]. These results thus suggest sizable uncertainty about the relative ratio of costs and benefits, emphasizing the further importance of accumulating additional evidence on the effectiveness and costs of these programs.</p><p xml:id="_7jDHj89">Moreover, the results in India are important because they suggest the possibility of large treatment effects with a much cheaper version of the program. In India, the direct transfers to households equaled roughly half of total program costs, compared to roughly a third in Ethiopia. Work on a graduation program in Ghana has found that neither simply providing access to savings, nor providing a one-off transfer of goats with no additional training, is sufficient to achieve the same impacts as those observed with the full graduation program <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Banerjee et al. 2022)</ref>, suggesting that the solution is not as straightforward as simply eliminating core components. We view the question of how to either pare down the cost of these programs (perhaps through reduced costs associated with scale up), or how to increase the effectiveness (e.g., by strengthening the socioemotional skills of individuals receiving the assets, as in Barker <ref type="formula">et al. (2022) and Bossuroy et al. (2022)</ref>), as important areas for future study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_sgfSC3G">IV. Conclusion</head><p xml:id="_pM6FN52">In Ethiopia, a transfer of productive assets, coupled with training, coaching and access to savings accounts induced large treatment effects on consumption, income and wealth two and three years later, and led to positive but diminished treatment effects seven years after the initial transfer. These fading treatment effects took place in a context in which control household living standards were improving consistently. We do not find evidence of dissipation of any of the previously accrued absolute improvements for treatment households. Consumption and related welfare measures continued to grow for both treatment and control households throughout the study period, with the gap across groups closing over time. These results differ from those of a similar program in India.</p><p xml:id="_G3rrhS5">A potentially important difference between the results in India and the ones here are the degree and nature of income diversification that followed from the initial, positive treatment effects on income. In both contexts, in the short-run, treatment households experienced gains in livestock revenues. In Ethiopia, households also engaged in income diversification, albeit narrowly in the domain of agriculture. Households cultivate more land, invest more on their farms, and in the short run, have higher revenues, although by year seven this effect is no longer significant. In India, the degree of income diversification was more sizable: households increased their earnings from fishing and horticulture, and from non-farm enterprises.</p><p xml:id="_PCjrHGs">Most importantly however, the two programs differ in the extent to which they facilitated additional migration. In India, both treated and control households increase their rate of migration and remittances by year seven; by year ten, treated households have 52% more remittances than control households. This appears to be driven by households being more likely to migrate to more distant locations, and for longer periods of time. In Ethiopia, while our results only extend through year seven, at no point do we observe an increase in remittances in Ethiopia, and migration rates to parts of Ethiopia outside of Tigray remained low for both treated and control households. These results suggest that either domestic migration to other parts of Ethiopia outside of Tigray were deemed unappealing, and/or that the constraints to such migration remained binding.</p><p xml:id="_Mszkw4N">Our results are largely inconsistent with the hypothesis that the program unlocked a poverty trap for poor households in Ethiopia, in contrast to what has been observed in India and Bangladesh (in which results are consistent with, albeit perhaps not dispositive of, the hypothesis that the programs pushed individuals over some critical threshold). This difference also matters from a policy perspective, as NGOs and governments consider the scale-up of graduation programs.</p><p xml:id="_Sqxpqda">In a public finance sense, the question is whether from a cost-effectiveness perspective they should be compared to short-run fixes of humanitarian poverty-based crises or compared to attempts to address long-run income and inclusive market development approaches. In a practical sense, this has implications for the number of years over which one would reasonably project benefits in a cost-benefit analysis. Of the six graduation pilots studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banerjee et al. (2015)</ref>, for none did the discounted benefits from the first three years exceed the costs. The five that did have benefits in excess of costs only did so with assumptions that the benefits continued past the three years, which seemed reasonable to assume some continuation given the similar results at two and three years. The predicted continued benefits have been realized in India, but have been positive but smaller in Ethiopia. The fading of results here, compared to the persistence elsewhere, suggest continued long-run study of these programs is essential in order to understand how and when such results persist.</p></div>

Unfortunately, in the time since our most recent data collection, the area where our study took place has experienced a severe, negative shock in the form of violent conflict and displacement.</p><p xml:id="_gB86B23">In the time since the end of the Civil War in 1992 until 2018, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the party sharing an ethnicity with our sample, has been a central power in Ethiopia's ruling coalition. This changed in 2018, when a new ruling coalition was formed that excluded the TPLF from power and led to tensions between the TPLF and the newly ruling Prosperity Party. These tensions transitioned to violent conflict in late 2020 (ten years after the program), with the proximate cause of disputes over the legitimacy of Tigrayan elections held during the COVID pandemic. As of October 2022, this conflict has led to an estimated 385,000-600,000 deaths and more than 2 million displacements <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(York 2022)</ref>; reporting suggests the study area was heavily affected.</p><p xml:id="_5DZkxSR">As of November 2022, a peace agreement was signed between the two parties; while conflict had not fully ceased, the parties agreed to a coordinated disarmament.</p><p xml:id="_5f9ZDcz">Thus, the extent to which treatment effects persisted or faded in our study site will depend on how the program interacted with this violent conflict and its immediate resolution, rather than with a context of macroeconomic growth and stability, as was the case from baseline through our three follow-ups. Previous work finds positive impacts of the graduation program in the face of conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bedoya et al. 2019 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brune et al. 2022</ref> report strong impacts in Afghanistan and modestly positive impacts in Yemen, respectively).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_zDVSDJv">APPENDICES Appendix A: Price Conversions</head><p xml:id="_zyCVc7Z">In order to ensure that any changes we observe (including among control households) reflect real differences in participant living standards, rather changing national prices which may or may not be reflected locally, we convert all prices from Ethiopian Birr (ETB) in the year of our survey to USD 2021 in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms using a basket of local prices and a multi-step procedure.</p><p xml:id="_fcRkUyb">We base our basket off prices faced by sample households for food. In our consumption modules, we identify all good-unit pairs (e.g., beer bottles of cooking oil) purchased by at least five households in each of the four waves. This restriction leaves us with 22 good-unit pairs. For each good-unit pair, we calculate the median purchase price per unit (which we use as our price in the price index), and the mean amount purchased (which we use as our quantity). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">1</ref> With these values, we construct a single Fisher price index for each wave. We estimate price indices of 151, 164 and 186 for our two-, three-and seven-year surveys, respectively (with our baseline survey standardized to 100).</p><p xml:id="_9cXDTxJ">As a comparison, the Consumer Price Index in Ethiopia for the three follow-up years (standardizing 2010 to 100), are 156, 168, and 240, respectively. These numbers suggest that national inflation is in line with locally observed inflation in our two-and three-year surveys, but that national inflation is substantially higher by 2017.</p><p xml:id="_Ss3mq9e">We first use our constructed indices to convert all values from ETB in the survey year to 2010 ETB. We then convert these values to 2021 USD PPP by multiplying by 4.28, the 2010 ETB-2010 USD PPP exchange rate (per the World Bank). Finally, we multiply this value by (271.0/218.1), the ratio of the US consumer price index in 2021 over the US consumer price index in 2010.</p><p xml:id="_ZPwbKUA">We are unable to perform a similar transformation in India, given the limited price data collected in their surveys at the good level-their respondents were instead asked to aggregate and report the value of consumption goods at the group level (e.g., "total value of cereals and cereal products consumed in the last 30 days"). Given this, we instead take the values in BDS (reported in 2017 USD PPP) and multiply by the ratio of the US Consumer Price Index in 2021 over the US Consumer Price Index in 2017.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_jR67uvg">Appendix B: Index Construction</head><p xml:id="_pqbUfRg">This section details the variables included in the indexed family outcomes, reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> (for a subset of outcomes) and Appendix Table <ref type="table">A4</ref> all outcomes). All monetary values are in 2021 USD PPP, using the procedure outlined in Appendix A (with the exception of asset ownership at baseline, where we lack price data; our estimation for these values is described below).</p><p xml:id="_nufW4Hf">Our asset ownership is the aggregate value of all assets owned by the household. This includes livestock, other productive assets (e.g. farm tools, sewing machines), and durable goods (such as phones, televisions, and furniture). In the two-, three-, and seven-year surveys, individuals are asked to estimate the value of the goods owned. At baseline, individuals report their ownership of goods, but do not estimate the value. We therefore recover estimates of their baseline value by taking the (inflation-adjusted) median value of each asset type across the three waves with data and multiplying this median price by quantities owned. Our index is a standardized value (i.e., baseline mean = 0, control standard deviation = 1) of the aggregate value. Component parts of the aggregate are reported in Appendix Table <ref type="table">A6</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_EMjJfJz">Our measure of per capita consumption is the aggregate of: (1) the value of all food consumed, equal to the quantities consumed multiplied by the median purchase price in the sample (asked about in the last month), (2) other expenditures incurred, such as school fees, soap, and home repairs (asked about in both the last month and last year, depending on the good in question), and</p><p xml:id="_7uB7Nk3">(3) the total purchase value of durable goods in the last 12 months. All values are scaled to be in monthly values. Our baseline survey does not ask about durable good purchases. We calculate baseline consumption absent durable good purchases, and include it as a baseline control, but do not include the mean in our tables, given the measure is not directly comparable. Our index is the aggregate value of consumption, standardized against the endline 1 control mean. Treatment effects for component parts are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_jF2edEg">The food security index is a z-score aggregate of the following five measures: everyone gets enough food every day, no adults skipped meals, no household member went a whole day without food, no children skipped meals, everyone eats at least two meals every day. We mimic BDS and report a subset of these outcomes in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>; the full set is reported in Appendix Table <ref type="table">A7</ref>. It is standardized against the baseline sample.</p><p xml:id="_QXvfMBy">The income and revenues index is a z-score index with the following measures: livestock revenues (equal to revenues from livestock sales and the value of livestock products, such as eggs, whey or honey), agricultural profits (equal to yields and rental income minus expenses, not including family labor), microenterprise profits (equal to revenues minus costs, again not counting family labor), wage earnings, (including via the Productive Safety Net Programme) and economic self-rating, on a scale of 1/10. Component parts are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>. The measures collected at baseline were not directly comparable, so we include them as controls, but standardize against the control group endline 1 mean.</p><p xml:id="_pfS2Stu">The financial security index is a z-score index, with the following measures: amount borrowed in the last 12 months from formal sources, amount borrowed in the last 12 months from informal sources, savings balance, and savings deposits in the last three months. It is standardized against the endline 1 control mean, given that savings questions were not about at baseline. Individual outcomes are reported in Appendix Table <ref type="table">A8</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_dz8eyUN">The productive time use index is an aggregate of minutes spent working per day on average in the last 48 hours (individuals report their time use in each of the last two days). Productive activities include time spent working on agriculture, tending to livestock, managing a business, and working for a wage. This value is standardized against the baseline sample. Component parts are reported in Appendix Table <ref type="table">A9</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_JpHf2PU">The physical health index is a z-score index that includes: no days missed due to poor physical health in the last month, a mean score of activities of daily living (ability to lift a 10 kg bag, ability to walk for four hours without resting, ability to work in a field all day), and a 1/5 rating of an individual's physical health. This index is standardized against the baseline sample, with component parts reported in columns 1-3 of Appendix Table <ref type="table">A10</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_k5suhYF">The mental health index is a z-score index that includes: a 1/5 overall life satisfaction rating, not having an extended period of time with worry in the last 12 months, and a stress index (with component parts including how often the individual felt sad, cried a lot, didn't feel like eating, didn't feel like doing their work, and had restless sleep). This index is standardized against the endline 1 control sample (given the stress index methodology was different at baseline); component parts are reported in columns 4-6 of Appendix Table <ref type="table">A10</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_FmCx6Pj">The political empowerment index is a z-score index that includes: whether the individual attended a meeting with a local leader of politician, whether they asked a question of a leader or politician at a local meeting, and whether they are a member of a political party. The index is standardized against the baseline sample; component parts are reported in columns 1-3 of Appendix Table <ref type="table">A11</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_SUSpeXk">The women's empowerment index is a z-score index that includes whether or not adult women in the household report having a major say in: food-related spending, education-related spending, healthcare-related spending, home improvement spending, and household management decisions. The index is standardized against the baseline sample; component parts are reported in columns 4-8 of Appendix Table A11.

Each cell reports results from a separate regression. Observations range from 889 to 915 for the household level outcomes in Ethiopia and from 679 to 875 in India, and from 723 to 1307 for the adult-level outcomes in Ethiopia and from 1,229 to 1,950 in India. For asset ownership, consumption and time use, outcomes are aggregated and then rescaled; other outcomes are a z-score index of outcomes variables in the given category. Outcomes are either (a) standardized so the baseline has mean zero and standard deviation one (done whenever possible), or (b) standardized so the endline 1 control group has mean zero and standard deviation one (done in cases where we do not have baseline data, or the baseline components differed from the components in subsequent waves). Reported q-values are sharpened using the false discovery rate procedure detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson (2008)</ref>. They reflect a correction for 10 family outcomes in Ethiopia, and 9 family outcomes in India.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_DAJAjEC">Appendix C: Cost-Benefit Simulations</head><p xml:id="_yfc33YS">We estimate the uncertainty of our cost-benefit estimates using bootstraps. In particular, we construct bootstrapped samples of our study population, re-calculate consumption benefits the bootstrapped sub-sample, and use these calculations to re-estimate the benefit-cost ratio.</p><p xml:id="_neMMPpM">We take our full sample of 925 households ever in the sample, and in each of 10,000 simulations, randomly draw 925 households from this sample with replacement. (In each bootstrap, we sample at the household, rather than household-survey wave level. This preserves any autocorrelation that might exist between waves). We then re-estimate household benefits (equal to monthly per capita consumption average treatment effects * household size * 12) for our two-, three-, and seven-year results, and store these estimates in a matrix.</p><p xml:id="_g6paQ57">For each of these 10,000 estimates, we perform the same calculations done from our main estimates on these bootstrapped estimates to re-calculate our benefit-cost ratio. In particular, we assume that year one consumption benefits equal year two benefits, and that the benefits from years three to seven evolve linearly. In cases where the benefits decline from years three to seven, we assume that they follow a linear decline, until the point they are equal to zero.</p><p xml:id="_Zagz3yj">In 19% of simulations, we find that benefits grew from years three to seven. For these simulations, we assume that benefits remain constant beyond year seven (rather than allowing these benefits to continue to grow in perpetuity). We additionally impose a cap that benefits extend for no more than 30 years. 2   We discount all benefits with an annual rate of 5%.</p><p xml:id="_b4kTHFG">Finally, for each of these 10,000 estimates, we calculate a benefit-cost ratio, by dividing the accumulated benefits over $4,011, our estimated program cost (we assume our costs are measured without error). We find that benefits exceed costs in 51.7% of our simulations; our median benefit-cost ratio is 1.02. Our 95% interval is [0.42, 2.36].</p><p xml:id="_2jXUARu">2 This simplification is done because there are households for whom consumption estimates decline between years three and seven, albeit very slowly (our 99 th percentile is an additional 363 years of benefits). Applying a perpetuity formula slightly overstates the benefits for these individuals, but there is no clear cut-off between "benefits extend forever" and "benefits ultimately reach zero." In practice, results are not very sensitive to the time horizon used in the very long run. Increasing our time horizon to 72 years increases the share for whom benefits exceed costs from 51.72% to 51.90%. Extending the benefits beyond year 72 is not pivotal for whether any additional households have benefits in excess of program costs.</p></div>

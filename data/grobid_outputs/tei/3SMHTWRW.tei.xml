<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_SVQaRsM"><p xml:id="_9RkqGfV">They also find that food and rent prices increase in the short term, but other prices decrease. A quasi-experimental evaluation of Syrian refugee inflows in Turkey shows that the likelihood of having an informal job declined by 2.26 percentage points for the natives, while formal employment increased by 0.46 percentage points, indicating a net decline in employment (Tumen, 2016).</p><p xml:id="_HxCzn2M">Rigorous evidence on the effect of the Rohingya refugee influx in the Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh is not available. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">1</ref> However, as discussed in detail in Section 2 of this paper, several descriptive studies provide evidence of a significant reduction in the earnings of host communities. They also show that the Rohingya influx has decreased the wage rate and increased poverty among the hosts. In this paper, we study a livelihood programme for the ultra-poor from Rohingya refugees' host communities in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. It is a customised version of BRAC's Ultra-Poor Graduation (UPG) programme, which was first piloted in rural Bangladesh in 2002 and has since been scaled up in 45 countries. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Several studies evaluating this programme in Bangladesh and other countries document its positive effects on the livelihoods of ultra-poor households (Bandiera et al., 2017; Banerjee et al., 2015). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Although these studies find large impacts of the programme, results vary across contexts. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We estimate the effects of the customised version of the programme on employment, income, expenditure and physical and financial assets of ultra-poor households in host communities.</p><p xml:id="_9dTJ2dK">Evidence shows that the host community's attitude towards refugees is mainly determined by the effects of the refugee influx on the opportunities available to hosts. For example, Aukot (2003) describes that host communities' grievances result from perceived inequalities of treatment in resource-constrained settings where refugees receive free shelter, firewood, food and healthcare, while the hosts do not. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Hence, it is expected that due to the programme implemented for Rohingya hosts by BRAC, treatment households are likely to report more opportunities available to them after the influx, thereby having a positive attitude towards Rohingya refugees. As such, we have also attempted to examine the effects of the programme on the participants' attitude towards Rohingya refugees using indicators related to opportunities and constraints faced by them.</p><p xml:id="_wCbzZa3">The results of this paper potentially have implications for other contexts as these findings can inform policy responses for host communities in a similar humanitarian context elsewhere. In addition to being one of the largest host communities in the world, the host community in Cox's Bazar is also relatively less affluent. Given the economic and social realities, the host could easily generate negative attitudes towards the refugees that could make the political challenges of host countries more difficult. The findings of this paper can potentially be informative for other contexts.</p><p xml:id="_QX7yb4E">Our paper contributes to the literature on poverty alleviation programmes. First, it extends the existing literature on livelihood programmes for host communities of refugee populations (International Labour Organization [ILO], 2019; Regional Development Consultants [RDC], 2018; Valli et al., 2019). Unlike the previous studies, our study is based on quantitative data and examines the effects on livelihoods (employment, income and consumption).</p><p xml:id="_xgwSwbg">Second, this paper extends the existing literature on the graduation programme by examining its effect in the humanitarian context (Bandiera et al., 2017; Banerjee et al., 2015). Existing literature shows that the graduation approach is highly effective for the general rural ultra-poor with a relatively stable labour market. Whether it is effective in the humanitarian context is a question worth exploring that we attempt to answer in our study. We also compare the effectiveness of the UPG programme across the host community and the general context of Bangladesh. Further, we examine whether the UPG programme reduces the tension between hosts and refugees. Hence we contribute to the literature on the tension between hosts and refugees (Aukot, 2003; Nielsen, 2016).</p><p xml:id="_PBkgzaW">We use a quasi-experimental approach on the 2018 cohort selected from five unions of Ukhiya and Teknaf subdistricts of Cox's Bazar, where the Rohingya refugees are living. Programme participants, selected using criteria such as income, asset and demographic characteristics, were divided into two groups. Group 1 was poorer than Group 2 in terms of observable characteristics. Thus, Group 1 received product assets as grants, training and other supports (hereafter grants-only intervention), while Group 2 received partial grants, training and other supports (hereafter hybrid intervention). This paper employs two rounds of data collected in 2018 (baseline) and 2020 (follow-up) on programme participants and nonparticipants. The nonparticipant group represents near-eligible households from the same community. We use a difference-in-difference (DiD) estimator to examine programme impacts. Results show that the programme increases the working-age population's labour supply in poultry and livestock rearing. Due to the programme support, the per capita real income of participant households of the grantsonly and hybrid interventions increases by 29% and 27%, respectively. The programme significantly increases the productive asset accumulation of both groups of participants. Results also show that the programme has positive effects on savings and rented land. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is estimated at 2.72 for the grants-only intervention, indicating that an investment of BDT 1.00 yields BDT 2.72. For the hybrid intervention, the BCR is estimated at 2.76.</p><p xml:id="_EjcBD3N">We find that compared to nonparticipants, the participants of the grants-only intervention are more likely to report that their income has increased due to the Rohingya refugee influx. This result suggests that they may be more likely to have positive attitudes towards the refugees as a result of the intervention. This may reduce the tension between the participants of this intervention and refugees. By contrast, the participants of the hybrid intervention are more likely to report theft, insecurity and less government support along with income increases. Hence, the effects of the hybrid intervention on the tension between the two communities are ambiguous. Overall, our results suggest that there is some weak evidence that the UPG programme decreases the tension between hosts and refugees.</p><p xml:id="_KYyeqwW">We have compared the results of our study with those from previous papers on the UPG programme studied in the general rural areas of Bangladesh. We find that the UPG programme is relatively less effective (particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness) in the humanitarian context. This is mainly due to the fact that the target population in the humanitarian context are more vulnerable.</p><p xml:id="_hvVXZQP">The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews related literature, while Section 3 discusses the context of the study. The intervention details are provided in Section 4. Section 5 discusses evaluation design, data collection and descriptive statistics. In Section 6, we present estimating equations, while Section 7 discusses the results. Section 8 provides a cost-benefit analysis and compares the results of this study with previous studies on similar interventions. Finally, Section 9 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2" xml:id="_JRTV3zp">| LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p xml:id="_Jd9Dtcb">A large number of literature has documented the effects of the Rohingya influx on the host communities' livelihoods, but most of them are based on descriptive statistics. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP, 2018) finds that the average daily labour wage was BDT 417 pre-influx and came down to BDT 357 after the influx-a 14% decline. The poverty rate also increased by about 3 percentage points in Teknaf and Ukhiya-shelters of most Rohingya refugees (UNDP, 2018). Another study finds that wage deterioration is more likely to induce short-term negative economic impacts than price increases (World Bank, 2019). A simulation exercise by Filipski et al. (2019)   shows that without any mitigating interventions, a rise of 800 000 Rohingya refugees-roughly the number of refugees entering Cox's Bazar between 2015 and 2018-causes a 31% drop in local wages. However, a study by IPA (2019) contrasts the above results. It shows that employment increased by 5 percentage points among the male population in host communities during pre-and post-influx. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> There is evidence of price increases in essentials due to the Rohingya influx. For example, Alam et al. (2020) show that overall food prices increased by 9%, and protein and vegetable prices increased by 8% and 36%, respectively, in the host region relative to other areas.</p><p xml:id="_aJHaQWp">A recent study, conducted on the impact of the Rohingya influx on host communities using data from 35 villages located nearby Rohingya camps, shows that between 2015 and 2020, the mean income of the sample households declined by 11% (Ullah et al., 2021). The study does not consider the counterfactual. Bangladesh's economy grew at a rate of more than 5% per year over the last decade. Assuming that the economy of the sample villages covered by Ullah et al. (2021) would have experienced the same growth (or at least, there would be no negative growth) if there was no refugee influx, these statistics indicate substantial negative effects of Rohingya refugee influx on the income of households in host communities. Further, as discussed in detail in Section 5 of this study, data from a nationally representative survey conducted in January 2021 by the BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD), BRAC University, show that in February 2020, 69% and 30% of working-age men and women, respectively, in the Cox's Bazar district were employed compared to 87% and 52% of men and women, respectively, in nearby Chattogram District. In other regions of the country, by contrast, 88% and 65% of men and women, respectively, were employed. These statistics also indicate substantial negative effects of the Rohingya refugee influx on the employment of host communities.</p><p xml:id="_smPE5dE">The theory regarding the reduction in wage and employment of host communities is as follows. If the refugees are not allowed to work formally, they may supply inexpensive labour in the informal market (Balkan &amp; Tumen, 2016).</p><p xml:id="_TFCuEQZ">In such a situation, informal native workers may be partly substituted by the refugees; Ceritoglu et al. (2015) document evidence of this for Syrian refugees. The native workers may then migrate to other parts of the country where the wage is likely to be higher, but market failures such as credit and informational constraints may constrain this (Byran et al., 2014). Consequently, the native informal workers may end up with lower earnings. Another channel is that because of the large refugee influx, native households may not be able to undertake activities such as fishing, foresting and so forth due to government restrictions. As a result of the Rohingya refugee influx, for example, an opportunity such as fishing declined because the government banned fishing in the nearby Naf River due to security reasons (International Organization for Migration [IOM], 2021).</p><p xml:id="_C4EDFzh">Rigorous evaluation of livelihood programmes for host communities is limited. Most of the existing studies use qualitative approaches. For example, the ILO (2019) evaluates a training programme for refugees and host communities in Ethiopia, focusing on improving the livestock herders' access to market information, regional trader networks and new local slaughterhouse and enhancing their entrepreneurial and business skills. The study finds that the intervention improved linkages between refugee and host community livestock herders and regional traders, thereby enhancing access to better economic opportunities. Another qualitative and descriptive assessment of a livelihood programme for host and displaced communities in Nigeria reports positive impacts (RDC, 2018). Using a randomised controlled trial (RCT), Valli et al. (2019) examined the effects of transfers, including cash, food and food vouchers, to Colombian refugees and poor Ecuadorians on social cohesion. They find that the intervention contributed to integrating Colombians into the hosting community through increases in personal agency, attitudes accepting diversity, confidence in institutions and social participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3" xml:id="_TfmQF7V">| THE CONTEXT</head><p xml:id="_8hqet4r">Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with about 1200 people living per square kilometre. The Cox's Bazar district, where the Rohingya refugees have taken shelter, is also densely populated. In August 2017, 641 000 Rohingya refugees entered Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, from the neighbouring Rakhine state of Myanmar to flee from the unrest and attacks directed towards them (UNDP, 2018). This number added to some 278 000 existing Rohingya refugees left previously in 1978 and 1992 (UNDP, 2018). Within a few months, Bangladesh became one of the major nations to host refugees, with 4.7% of the total refugee population in the world.</p><p xml:id="_ZJdW5ZW">Teknaf and Ukhiya-the two southern subdistricts of Cox's Bazar-are bearing the highest burden, with Rohingya refugees constituting more than a third of the local population (UNDP, 2018). Currently, there are two government-run refugee camps-Kutupalong in Ukhiya and Nayapara in Teknaf. Additionally, there also exist 25 smaller camps.</p><p xml:id="_4TgAva3">Bangladesh Government attempted to resettle the refugees in Bhashan Char's island, and so far (November 2021), only 20 000 refugees have relocated. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> According to UNDP (2018), the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) refers to Rohingya who entered Bangladesh since August 2017 as Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMNs). Further, they are not recognised as 'registered refugees', but the United Nations (UN) system is mobilising humanitarian aid for these displaced persons. However, in this paper, we refer to them as refugees.</p><p xml:id="_FnU4RVV">When the influx occurred during August-October 2017, the Cox's Bazar District Administration bore the brunt of the emergency operation, providing land, food, shelter and other settlement logistics. As UNDP (2018) mentions, at the initial stage of the crisis, most initiatives were related to immediate crisis response, but the enormity and complexity of the need to provide immediate food and shelter to so many people required joint efforts. Thus, the humanitarian community worked closely with the GoB to draw up its Joint Response Plan (JRP) for 2018 (March-December). The JRP covers strengthening government institutions and systems in the area of health, nutrition, water, sanitation, hygiene, education, agriculture, forestry and the environment.</p><p xml:id="_V7JNhxp">As mentioned previously, the Rohingya influx has negative effects on the livelihoods of host communities, but evidence shows that the support for the host communities is little. An assessment conducted by Save the Children, BRAC, World Vision, World Food Programme (WFP) and UNHCR (2018) shows that the impact of the influx of refugees on the host communities has been substantial, but to date, they have received very minimum support from the international humanitarian community or local government.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4" xml:id="_MekkzAt">| THE INTERVENTION</head><p xml:id="_569T6sH">Since 2002, BRAC's UPG programme 8 has been working for the poorest to create a sustainable livelihood pathway for them. It is implemented through BRAC's local offices known as 'branch offices' across Bangladesh. The programme has gained notable popularity over the years <ref type="bibr">9</ref> and has gone through many iterations and modifications over time, following careful and continuous research on the ultra-poor and changing surroundings. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> To tackle the humanitarian crisis of Rohingya refugees, BRAC, in collaboration with UNHCR, implemented a customised version of the UPG programme for the host communities. The main objective was to support the vulnerable host communities cope with the ongoing challenges and ensure self-sustainable livelihoods. The programme design was modified to a unique set of targeting criteria and support to address their unique vulnerabilities. The participant selection process, however, was done following the usual rigorous and multistaged process (Bandiera   et al., 2017). The process involves participatory wealth ranking (PWR), household survey and further verification 7 <ref type="url" target="https://www.thedailystar.net/rohingya-influx/news/bhashan-char-relocation-un-looking-plug-the-gaps-2902956">https://www.thedailystar.net/rohingya-influx/news/bhashan-char-relocation-un-looking-plug-the-gaps-2902956</ref> 8 Formerly the programme was known as the Targeting the Ultra-Poor (TUP) programme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_kptBbN7">9</head><p xml:id="_dyCJVN5">The UPG programme implemented in rural areas across the country is found to be very effective in improving the economic and social lives of the participant households (Ara et al., 2017; Bandiera et al., 2017; Das &amp; Misha, 2010).</p></div>

The programme planned to cover 2 000 ultra-poor households in Teknaf and Ukhiya subdistricts in Cox's Bazar.</p><p xml:id="_VDYqGwC">As mentioned previously, the programme was implemented for two groups of participant households in Cox's Bazar. These households must fulfil the following prerequisites:</p><p xml:id="_4nAxSxB">• Per capita daily income is less than USD 1.90 at the purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate.</p><p xml:id="_G3hNH9t">• There is at least one physically active 11 female member in the household.</p><p xml:id="_uGNwS5B">• Any household member is not a current borrower of any formal financial/microfinance institution.

To be eligible for the grants-only intervention, a household must fulfil Criterion 1.1 and either of the remaining two criteria. By contrast, to be eligible for the hybrid intervention, a household must meet any two out of the four criteria. Hence, as per the targeting criteria, the participants of the grants-only intervention are more vulnerable than those of the hybrid intervention. This distinction was made because the former group received assets as grants, while the latter received partial loans, that is, some credit and some grants (towards purchasing a productive asset or initiating a small business venture).</p><p xml:id="_wj3ySZH">The complete support package offered to the programme participants includes the following components (a summary of the support components is provided in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p><p xml:id="_8AbzumT">i. Enterprise development training Selected participants of both interventions choose suitable enterprises from a set of options selected by the programme based on their surroundings, enterprise management experience, household members' physical fitness, availability of relevant services and the scope of marketing outputs/assets. The options include cow rearing, goat rearing, poultry rearing, land cultivation and nonfarm business. To help the participants select an enterprise, the programme staff also discussed several issues with them. These include potential income and expenditure, the pros and cons of managing the enterprise, loan repayment details (if selected for the hybrid intervention) and supporting services provided by the programme.</p><p xml:id="_QgnCTZy">Upon selecting enterprises, participants receive enterprise development training to learn how to properly maintain assets, develop business strategies, improve enterprise management skills, build confidence and plan for the future. During the 3-day-long training, separate sessions are organised for both groups of participants, with no more than 25 participants per batch. Later, during the programme cycle, which is usually two calendar years-11 'Active' refers to being physically capable of maintaining the enterprise offered by the UPG programme.</p></div>

Although our comparison group consists of near-eligible households, we find that they were well-off than both groups of participants in terms of various observable baseline characteristics. Thus, one may question if this group can be an appropriate counterfactual for estimating the impact of the interventions. However, we know that if the parallel trend assumption holds, DiD estimator can identify the unbiased estimates of treatment impacts. This assumption, sometimes referred to as the 'common trends' assumption (Angrist &amp; Pischke, 2009), states that the average outcomes for treatment and comparison groups would have moved in parallel had the treatment not occurred.</p><p xml:id="_5hjBpkJ">The baseline survey collected data on the amount of land, poultry and livestock for the 2 years before the baseline, using a recall method. We use these data to test if there is indeed any common trend in these outcomes across our treatment and comparison groups during the 3 years (2016-2018) prior to the intervention. Figure <ref type="figure">b1</ref> in the Appendix shows the trends of the three asset items for three groups of households. It appears that for land and poultry, there is a parallel trend for participants of the grants-only intervention (Group 1) and its comparison group and also for the participants of the hybrid intervention (Group 2) and its comparison group. For livestock, the trends are slightly less parallel. However, to formally test for parallel trend, we estimate the following DiD regression using pre-intervention panel data (2016-2018):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y it = α + β 1 Grants i + β 2 YEAR2 t + β 3 YEAR3 t + β 4 YEAR2 t * Grants i + β 5 YEAR3 t * Grants i + ϵ it (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p xml:id="_GBxkMDt">where A y it is the outcome variable of interest (land, poultry and livestock) for household i in year t (2016, 2017 and 2018); A YEAR2 t is an indicator variable taking the value of 1 if t refers to 2017 and 0 if otherwise; A YEAR3 t is an indicator variable taking the value of 1 if t refers to 2018 and 0 if otherwise; A Grants i is an indicator variable taking the value of 1 if household i was exposed to the grants-only intervention and 0 if nonparticipant; and A ϵ it is an error term. A similar equation is estimated for examining parallel trends among households selected for the hybrid intervention and comparison group. If the estimates of A β 4 and A β 5 are not statistically significant, they will indicate a parallel trend in the outcome between treatment and comparison groups. Regression results reported in Tables <ref type="table">A3</ref> and <ref type="table">A4</ref> in the Appendix show that the estimates of A β 4 and A β 5 are not statistically significant, indicating that there is a parallel trend among treatment and comparison groups in the pre-intervention period.</p><p xml:id="_7U47Vpm">Finally, using 2018-2020 panel data, we estimate DiD regression to examine the impacts of the programme on the outcome variables of interest. We also control for individual/household fixed effects. These controls are likely to improve the precision of the estimate. Specifically, we estimate the following regression equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y it = α i + β 1 YEAR t + β 2 Grants i * YEAR t + β 3 Hybrid i * YEAR t + ϵ it (<label>2</label></formula><p xml:id="_xsu4Fa6">) Here, A α i is the individual/household fixed effects; A y it is the outcome variable of interest for individual/household i in year t; A Grants i is a binary variable taking the value of 1 if the individual/household i received the grants-only intervention and 0 otherwise; A Hybrid i is also a binary variable taking the value of 1 if the individual/household received the hybrid intervention and 0 otherwise; A YEAR t is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if t refers to follow-up (2020) T A B L E 5 Employment rate among working-age men and women in Cox's Bazar, Chattogram and other regions in February 2020 Cox's Bazar Chattogram Other districts Male 68.5% 86.5% 87.6% Female 30.3% 51.8% 65.2% Source: Authors' calculation based on data collected by BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD), Brac University. and 0 if t refers to baseline (2018); and A ϵ it is an error term. If the parallel trend holds, cov ( A ϵ it , A Grants i * YEAR t ) = 0 and cov ( A ϵ it , A Hybrid i * YEAR t ) = 0 (Khandker et al., 2009). Since our data show that the parallel trend assumption is likely to hold, we assume that cov ( A ϵ it , A Grants i * YEAR t ) = 0 and cov ( A ϵ it , A Hybrid i * YEAR t ) = 0. Thus, A β 2 and A β 3 in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) identify the causal effects of the grants-only and hybrid interventions, respectively.</p><p xml:id="_4ANgMgG">Our estimates are likely to be biased if there are spillover effects as the comparison and treatment households are from the same communities. Existing evidence, however, shows that the UPG programme has no spillover effects on livestock assets, land, time devoted to livestock rearing, earnings and food expenditures of ineligible households (Bandiera   et al., 2017). They, however, find that the programme increases the value of other business assets (pumps, livestock sheds, trees and rickshaws), agricultural labour and work as housemaids of ineligible households. These results indicate that our estimates of the effects of main outcomes, such as time devoted to livestock rearing, income, food expenditure and productive assets (cow, goat, chicken and land), are unlikely to be biased due to the spillover effect of the programme.</p></div>

Hence, in the rest of the paper, we report and discuss the results estimated after controlling for individual/household fixed effects.</p><p xml:id="_3kqDNb8">Results show that the programme increases working-age males' labour supply in poultry and livestock rearing (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). The magnitude of the effects is large and economically meaningful. For the grants-only intervention, it is equal to 216% of the nonparticipant group's mean at the follow-up, and for the hybrid intervention, the proportion is 289%. These results are quite expected since the grants-only intervention provided households with grants in the form of mainly poultry and livestock and the hybrid intervention provided households with partial loans to purchase similar assets. The magnitude of the effect on labour supply in poultry and livestock seems higher for the hybrid intervention. Time devoted to vegetable/fish cultivation also significantly increases for both groups of participants.</p><p xml:id="_2bdKxKc">Further, the hybrid intervention increases the time devoted to agriculture.</p><p xml:id="_HfhZy7b">The programme also increases working-age females' time devoted to poultry and livestock rearing. The effect on this outcome for the grants-only intervention is about 142% of the nonparticipant group's mean at the follow-up, and the corresponding proportion for the hybrid intervention is 132%. The intervention increases working-age females' time devoted to agricultural work and vegetable/fish cultivation as well. This rise is mainly due to increased access to cultivable land through the rental market (discussed later). But the magnitudes of the effects for both groups are low compared to the impact on the time devoted to poultry and livestock rearing. The grants-only intervention has reduced the time devoted to domestic help/begging significantly. The hybrid intervention, on the other hand, reduces the labour supply in household chores.

Results show that the programme significantly increases livestock and poultry ownership of both groups of households. This result is expected because, as discussed earlier, both groups received training mostly on these assets. Moreover, the participants of the grantsonly intervention received these assets as grants, while the participants of the hybrid intervention were disbursed loans and cash grants to buy these assets. Consequently, the programme significantly increases the total value of households' productive assets 18 among both groups of households. The magnitude of the increase is more than twice the average grants/credit-plus-grants provided by the programme to the participants. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Land is an important productive asset in rural Bangladesh, as the agriculture sector provides employment opportunities for about 40% of the employed population aged 15 or above (BBS, 2018). But ultra-poor households have minimal access to cultivable land compared to other wealth groups (Bandiera et al., 2017). We do not find any statistically significant effect on cultivable land ownership (Table <ref type="table">9</ref>). This finding is perhaps not surprising, as it is too early to enable the ultra-poor to purchase land. Evaluating the UPG programme in rural Bangladesh, Bandiera et al. (2017)   find no significant impact on owned land 2 years after the programme. However, they find a significant impact on it 4 years after the programme.</p><p xml:id="_dvwy36V">The programme, however, increases cultivable land taken on lease/mortgaged/sharecropped for both groups of participants. This finding resonates with the reported increases in working-age members' time devoted to agricultural work and vegetable/fish cultivation for both groups. Moreover, both interventions increase homestead land.</p></div>

We find statistically significant impacts on savings (Table <ref type="table">11</ref>). The participants of the grants-only and hybrid interventions were 43 and 46 percentage points, respectively, more likely to have savings than nonparticipants.

Within a country, refugees tend to be located in relatively poorer and marginalised areas, making the tension between the host and refugee communities much more acute. Livelihood programmes are thus essential to eliminate the tension among host communities.</p><p xml:id="_dqKGXnx">Global evidence on the livelihood programmes' evaluation for the host communities is, however, limited. Thus, we evaluate BRAC's graduation programme for host communities in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh-the current residence of about 1 million Rohingya refugees.</p><p xml:id="_mcHkeBv">In assessing our findings from the perspective of graduation from extreme poverty, it is worth noting that participants are expected to have access to better livelihood options through self-employment upon graduation from the UPG programme (and hence out of extreme poverty). They are also likely to experience improved financial inclusion through access to formal/semiformal financial products, enhanced social integration with the knowledge of various social and health issues and access to mainstream social and financial services. Considering all these aspects, overall, our results imply that the UPG programme targeted towards the ultra-poor from the host communities in Cox's Bazar is highly effective.</p><p xml:id="_8PDEKFW">At a broader level, our findings indicate that this programme is effective for ultra-poor households in the context where the opportunity for wage employment is scarce and prices of essentials are higher due to shocks such as a large influx of migrants or refugees. Such adverse effects on the local labour market, especially for the poorest who rely on casual wage labour, due to a sudden and large-scale refugee influx are the reality in many refugee humanitarian contexts. These adverse impacts generate economic turmoil and add to the host-refugee high tension dynamics, which adversely affect the broader humanitarian action.</p><p xml:id="_sb2hN6K">Therefore, the graduation approach's success in such a context is promising and should be considered a part of humanitarian-development nexus programming (Zetter, 2019). As our evidence indicates, such an approach can also provide an effective and practical basis for improving the host-refugee tension and pave the way for better humanitarian action.</p><p xml:id="_CtRQePQ">The main limitation of this study is that the BCR is calculated using only one round of follow-up survey data. Thus, we cannot say with certainty the extent to which the benefits will change in the near future. Bandiera et al. (2017)   show that such graduation intervention's impacts are even higher in the long run than in the short run. Since our cost-benefit analysis is based on only one follow-up survey data, there remains the possibility of reporting lower than actual benefits that the programme produces.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc xml:id="_7uz7D5X">Further, the net cropped area of Cox's Bazar (35%) is lower than the national rate (54%) (Bangladesh Bureau of 6 IPA (2019) also shows that while female employment increased substantially (20%), the overall low female employment (29% prior to the refugee influx) suggests the increase in female employment has little effect on the total household income. Statistics [BBS], 2021). The situation of this district is also worsened by the high prevalence of natural disasters and climatic change-related shocks.</figDesc></figure>

Column 3 reports the effects of the grants-only intervention studied by Bandiera et al. (2017).</p><p xml:id="_jnQnxxn">Note that Bandiera et al. (2017) cover households from 13 of the poorest districts. In Column 4, on the other hand, we report results from a hybrid intervention studied by Rahman et al. (2021). This study uses RCT and covers 11 districts of Bangladesh. Results show that the grants-only intervention studied in this paper is more effective compared to the similar intervention studied for the general context of Bangladesh (Columns 1 and 3). The former is, however, less effective in terms of cost-effectiveness. This is mainly because the grants-only intervention studied by Bandiera   et al. (2017) is found to generate larger impacts in the long run (4 years). For example, while there is no statistically significant effect on consumption expenditure in the short run, the long-run effect is large and statistically significant.</p><p xml:id="_RatPqB8">The hybrid intervention studied in this paper is less effective compared to a similar intervention studied in the general context of Bangladesh (Columns 2 and 4). This intervention is also less effective in terms of cost-effectiveness.</p><p xml:id="_2A82RN3">These results suggest that the UPG programme implemented in the humanitarian context is less effective. The reason for the less effectiveness of the programme implemented for the host communities in Cox's Bazar is perhaps contextual issues. The households covered by the hybrid intervention in our study are poorer than those covered by the hybrid intervention studied by Rahman et al. (2021). For example, at baseline, per capita income of the participant households of the hybrid intervention studied in this paper was BDT 1 188 compared to BDT 1 510 of the participants of the hybrid intervention studied by Rahman et al. (2021). <ref type="bibr">26</ref> Further, Rahman et al. (2021) show that the intervention is less effective for poorer households. This perhaps explains why the hybrid intervention studied in the context of Cox's Bazar, where Rohingya refugees took shelter, is less effective.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_uNhfn9u">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_kB26v4s">Developing countries spend, on average, 1.5 percent of GDP on social safety net programs and reach over 1 billion people with at least one program <ref type="bibr">(World Bank, 2018)</ref>. Such programs have multiple goals. They seek to both address current consumption and poverty and to facilitate investments that will reduce future poverty <ref type="bibr">(Das, Do, Ozler 2005)</ref>. Their success in the first goal is readily apparent; transfers reduce the incidence of absolute poverty (US$1.90 PPP per day) by 36 percent <ref type="bibr">(World Bank, 2018)</ref>. Impacts on a diverse set of productive investments are also apparent, albeit often less pronounced, partially reflecting their multiple objectives. These range from increased schooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baird et al. 2014)</ref>, enhanced agricultural earnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina 2012)</ref>, and additional migration for employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ardington, Case, and Hosegood 2009)</ref>. Another explicit objective for many transfer programs is improved nutrition.</p><p xml:id="_zdacbYK">Favorable impacts on anthropometric outcomes are commonly noted although, on average, these are small. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Manley et al. (2022)</ref> found a significant, but modest 1.35 percent average reduction in child stunting from cash transfer programs in a recent meta-analysis of 129 studies.</p><p xml:id="_uR6Cxhb">Graduation model programs expand on the concept of targeted cash or food transfers supporting consumption, by providing an additional lump sum asset or cash transfer designed to promote and sustain poverty alleviation. These graduation programs often include intensive livelihood training or mentoring to support higher earnings as well as measures to promote financial inclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandiera et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Banerjee et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bossuroy et al. 2022)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_zn3QEqa">Occasionally, they also include explicit measures to increase women's empowerment or reduce stress. Graduation model programs have been tested in many countries following the publication of results from a six-country study of programs styled after BRAC's Targeting the Extremely poor (TUP) program in Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Banerjee et al. 2015)</ref>. Evaluations of these programs have demonstrated their potential to improve economic outcomes, but most of these programs were not designed to include nutrition interventions and generally do not report impacts on nutrition outcomes.</p><p xml:id="_kqw7qt2">Graduation model programs may be strengthened by including nutrition objectives and explicit nutrition programming for several reasons. Graduation programs are frequently targeted to the extreme poor in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Malnutrition is often, but not always, co-located with this poverty. Thus, reducing malnutrition is consistent with the objective of graduation programs to achieve sustainable long-term improvements in wellbeing for participants and their communities and to address outcomes beyond monetary poverty. There is some evidence that transfers must be accompanied with other design features such as nutrition training and access to health services to be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Manley et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ahmed et al. 2019)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_hjcehc2">Still, currently little is known about how to design graduation programs in terms of the size of the asset transfer and the approach to nutrition services to successfully achieve improvements in child nutrition.</p><p xml:id="_FVaqsTh">The current study aims to address this lacuna. It reports the results of a cluster randomized control trial (cRCT) to assess the impact on child nutrition of a 'light-touch' graduation program that includes nutrition interventions of varying intensity, provided to beneficiaries of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), one of the largest social protection programs on the continent. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Implemented at scale, the graduation program provided PSNP beneficiaries with additional livelihood programming including savings groups, business skills training and linkages to financial services. In addition, extremely poor households received a one-time livelihood transfer on an experimental basis, either as cash transfers or in-kind poultry grants. These were at a value much smaller than those studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Banerjee et al. (2015)</ref>, which were up to 4 times larger (in 2017 PPP dollars) and had accompanying intensive livelihoods training and technical support.</p><p xml:id="_r9EDBPK">Child stunting, and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices and knowledge were the primary and secondary nutrition outcomes 2 evaluated by this cRCT, which was adequately powered to assess a significant difference in these outcomes. Using this data this paper makes two main contributions to the literature on graduation. First, it documents the contribution of both cash and in-kind livelihood support on nutrition. Second, it indicates whether such grants can be enhanced with the provision of nutritional services. Results show that interaction with health care workers and participation in community health activities increased significantly under the enhanced nutrition model, as did maternal nutritional knowledge. Neither nutrition model led to significant improvements in child stunting on average. However, cash livelihood grants combined with the enhanced nutrition model reduced childhood stunting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_fXzh4Q2">Study Context in Relation to Current Literature</head><p xml:id="_dKKvgJh">Behavioral change communication (BCC) is a regular component of nutrition interventions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Keats et al. (2021)</ref> deem the evidence on the contribution of BCC for effective implementation of breastfeeding promotion and for education on complementary feeding in conjunction with food provision to be strong in food insecure settings but only moderate without food provision in more food secure populations. This implies potential program complementarity with transfer programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Olney et al. 2022)</ref>. A few programs that include regular grants during the critical years for child growth as well as packages of services along with nutrition focused BCC have reported significant impacts on child nutrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cahyadi et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Carneiro et al. 2021</ref>). 2 The pre-analysis plan for the evaluation is linked at the AEA RCT registry for this trial (registry number AEARCTR-0008281): <ref type="url" target="https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/8281">https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/8281</ref>. However, only a few studies have directly assessed the impact of BCC in conjunction with transfers compared to transfers alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Little et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Field and Maffioli 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ahmed, Hoddinott, and Roy 2019)</ref>. Although ultimately the goal of behavioral change is generally to improve nutritional outcomes, studies often focus on knowledge and behaviors around IYCF which appear more responsive to interventions than do anthropometric indicators. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Han, Kim, and Park (2021)</ref> look at BCC and food vouchers in Ethiopia and conclude that neither intervention alone influences child feeding practices or chronic child undernutrition, but the combination does. This is the first study we are aware of to provide systematic evidence on the effectiveness of nutrition BCC delivered at scale as an integral part of a graduation program for extremely poor households on child growth. While the literature on graduation programs regularly examines impacts on food security, relatively few studies look at child nutritional status or diet diversity among transfer recipients. For example, none of the six country studies in the seminal paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Banerjee et al. (2015)</ref> nor those by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bandiera et al. (2017)</ref>, Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez (2020), or Bosseroy et al. (2022)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> include evidence on child stunting or underweight<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> . <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Haushofer and Shapiro (2016)</ref> report results on an overall health index in which nutrition is a component but find no impact from either the monthly or the larger lump sum transfer on this composite measure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McIntosh and Zeitlin (2021)</ref> show the impact of lump sum transfers on nutritional outcomes and compare the impact to an in-kind nutritional and maternal health intervention in Rwanda with cash transfers and find significant effects on anthropometric outcomes in one sub-arm of the cash component in the study. However, they do not explore the complementarity of cash in health interventions.</p><p xml:id="_BuSrVPj">As well as comparing cash transfers to in-kind services, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McIntosh and Zeitlin (2021)</ref> include a range of transfer allocations to benchmark the size of transfers that might result in improved nutrition. They find that only the largest transfer, which was more than twice as large as the one in the light-touch graduation program studied here, had an impact of 0.1 standard deviations on anthropometry, significant at the 10 percent level. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> The current study builds on those findings by investigating whether a considerably smaller transfer than provided in several published graduation programs can enhance child nutritional status by exploiting complementarities in scalable nutrition-focused services.</p><p xml:id="_TCRCQ4e">In addition to exploring complementarity within a graduation program, the study's experimental design compares the impact of two models of nutrition investment, an enhanced model of more intensive BCC along with components designed to strengthen male support to investments in child nutrition and support to women's wellbeing, including mental health as well as a less intensive community nutrition program that did not directly support household visits.</p><p xml:id="_uCHDuNx">The goal of the intensive mode of delivery is in keeping with <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim et al. (2020)</ref> who report results of trials in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Vietnam designed to directly compare intensive interpersonal contact relative to alternate standard nutrition BCC programs. All three of these studies confirmed that the frequency of contact matters for diet diversity and breastfeeding practices. <ref type="bibr">Kim et</ref>  <ref type="formula">al. (2019)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_mr5YZjX">Evaluation Design</head><p xml:id="_jWM3DSW">While the PSNP was initiated in 2005, it did not include a specific nutrition component until the fourth phase (PSNP4) launched in 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Berhane et al. 2020)</ref>. To date, neither the earlier stages nor the fourth phase of PSNP have shown any acceleration of the national trend in reducing stunting <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Berhane et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abay et al. 2023)</ref> Across all treatment arms, as well as the control group, PSNP clients participating in public works were eligible to attend six monthly 2-hour BCC sessions in place of 4 person-days of work over the six-month period. Also in all treatment arms, a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) component included implementation of a community-led total sanitation and hygiene (CLTSH) activity and Open Defecation Free (ODF) public education events, as well as the provision of support to village-level WASH management activities and limited support to improving potable water and sanitation infrastructure (water sources and latrines). In both the CN and EN treatments these services were augmented by IYCF and nutrition BCC discussions in VESAs. Topics covered included optimal IYCF practices, adolescent and maternal nutrition, diversified sources of nutritious foods, and utilization of health and nutrition services.</p><p xml:id="_AGgwqMF">The EN interventions built upon these core nutrition activities by supporting government health extension staff and volunteers to additionally deliver BCC lessons on IYCF practices and adolescent and maternal nutrition through a Timed and Targeted Counseling (TTC) model at the household level. The TTC model envisions 11 home visits in the first 1,000 days after conception, 4 of which should be during pregnancy, 2 in the first month post-partum, 4 more when the child is between 1 and 12 months and another visit when the child is between 14 and 18 months. Additional services in the EN treatment kebeles were targeted to caregivers of children screened for acute malnutrition based on mid-upper arm circumference or underweight based on weight for age. These Community-Based Participatory Nutrition Promotion sessions (CPNP) included training on complementary feeding and caring practices within two-week intensive feeding sessions.</p><p xml:id="_sUDF5eN">These activities were coordinated by trained Community Health Facilitators (CHF) who were recruited and assigned to each of the kebeles to support the health extension workers (HEWs) in planning, coordinating, and facilitating health and nutrition activities. The CHF also supported local Health Development Army (HDA) volunteers to conduct household-level counseling related to IYCF and maternal nutrition using the TTC approach. Both husband and wife were encouraged to be present for these counseling sessions to promote male engagement in targeted IYCF and maternal nutrition actions. In addition, local facilitators supported the formation of men's engagement groups and facilitated eight sessions designed to critically reflect on cultural gender norms and explore the positive and perceived negative effects of male involvement in household chores and childcare activities that were typically assigned as women's only tasks. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">6</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> summarizes the key programs by treatment arm. These services were not provided in the control.</p><p xml:id="_KVUJqeP">Comparatively poor households among the already food insecure PSNP client households in the two enhanced livelihood program treatment arms received a livelihood transfer ($200 equivalent in local currency). The kebeles in these arms of the study were randomly selected to provide either a one-time cash transfer to the subset of relatively poor households or a poultry package of equivalent value. In each of these kebeles the 10 poorest households of the baseline survey sample of 18 households were chosen to receive these transfers through a ranking assessment based on an asset index. The asset index included ownership data on more than 30 asset categories, including consumer durables, productive assets, livestock, and land. It was constructed using principal components analysis, in which the first component maximizes the variation of all variables explained by that component, and therefore gives high weights to variables that are highly correlated with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Filmer and Pritchett 2001)</ref>. These households are the main focus of this study and are deemed extremely poor in subsequent discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_QPHMhtE">Data</head><p xml:id="_zuy5k3d">The data were collected over three rounds, with a baseline collected between February and April 2018, a midline survey between July and October 2019, and an endline survey originally planned for 2020, 24 months after the baseline, but delayed an additional 12 months due to COVID-19.</p><p xml:id="_qx8KaGB">Initially, 196 kebeles in Amhara (115 kebeles) and Oromia (81 kebeles) regions were selected for the trial and subsequently randomized into treatment groups. However, two kebeles had no PSNP clients and thus were not eligible for the program. Two other kebeles experienced ongoing civil unrest and were necessarily dropped from the project. Thus, the evaluation sample comprises 192 kebeles. In each kebele, 18 households were randomly sampled, leading to a planned baseline sample of 3,456 households in the study. The inclusion criteria for the sample were that households had to (1) be a PSNP client household, (2) have at least one child aged 0-35 months (the index child), and (3) have the mother or primary female caregiver<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> of the 0-35month-old child as a member of the household. The last criterion enabled measurement of maternal and child diets as well as child-care for nutritionally vulnerable ages in all sample households. The actual baseline sample consisted of 3,314 households.</p><p xml:id="_nKHYWjU">The endline survey sought to re-interview any baseline household unless it had permanently moved or dissolved by the time of the midline survey. Of the 3,248 households in the endline target sample, 3,094 were located and interviewed, implying an attrition rate of 4.7 percent relative to the target sample, or 6.6 percent relative to the original baseline sample.</p><p xml:id="_XqwTPEP">Nearly half of the attrition (70 households or 2 percent of the target sample) at endline was due to insecurity in one of the operational woredas in Amhara that resulted in a decision not to visit four kebeles. Among the remaining 84 attrited households, 48 had moved out of the study area, 24 were temporarily unavailable, and other households had either dissolved or were unavailable for the interview for other reasons; one household refused consent. In total, 3,062 primary female respondents and 2,482 primary male respondents were surveyed. The delay in the endline data collection necessitated by COVID-19 meant that most of the additional midline sample children were older than 24 months by the endline contrary to the initial intent. However, 905 of the baseline index children had younger siblings less than 24 months who were included in the endline sample and contributed to outcome measures for children less than 2 years old at endline.</p><p xml:id="_Jmf9bpd">Even so, the sample for the analysis of current feeding practices and contact with healthcare workers is smaller than at the baseline<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">foot_6</ref> .</p><p xml:id="_BktZD7K">The endline household interview was conducted in three parts: household-level questions covering household and respondent identification and household demographics; a set of questions for the identified primary male respondent; and a set of questions for the identified primary female respondent.

Next, we report on the primary outcome of interest, stunting, defined, as is generally done, as a child's height for age being two or more standard deviations below the age and gender specific median. We also include other anthropometric outcomes in this step. The regressions use the following model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑌 𝑖1 = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 𝐸𝑁 + 𝛽 2 𝐶𝑁 + 𝛽 3 𝑋 𝑖0 + 𝜎 𝑤 + 𝜀 𝑖 , (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p xml:id="_7v6Q3Vk">where Yi1 is the outcome variable at endline, EN indicates randomized assignment to the enhanced nutrition intervention, and CN indicates randomized assignment to the core nutrition intervention delivered at the community level. Xi0 is a vector of controls, including child age, child gender, maternal education, and woreda level fixed effects. The anthropometric outcomes are reported for the entire sample. However, in as much as the focus of this analysis is the contribution of livelihood grants to nutrition, we repeat the overall assessment of the EN and CN programs using only the subsample of extremely poor. As any outcome, or absence of impact, reflects the additional services supported through SPIR, we then investigated the impact of the EN and CN models on access to the services provided and on any changes in diets. These secondary results reflect the major inputs into the production of health that the project aspired to influence. We focus on the extremely poor 9 , testing the effects of the interventions on recipients of cash and of poultry relative to each other. In the communities that received enhanced nutrition we also compare the impacts of the EN intervention for grant recipients with the results for other extremely poor households. As there are no extremely poor households who did not receive grants in the CN arm of the study, this comparison is not available.</p><p xml:id="_hRvxqRD">Child age is handled in slightly different ways depending on features of the outcome studied. In the case of anthropometry, age is included to accommodate differences in growth velocity and biological needs of children as well as the cumulative impact of programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alderman and Headey 2018)</ref>. Thus, the anthropometry regression which cover children up to 36 months includes a variable for age in months. In contrast, the diet data covers a smaller sample 9 The overall impacts of the EN and CN programs on the respective communities are of interest to the SPIR program planners and have been reported in the endline report <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alderman et al. 2021)</ref>. We also report summary results for the less poor and the extremely poor at the end of this paper.</p><p xml:id="_jcDX5k8">of children up to 24 months since the module was not administered neither to parents of children above 24 months nor to parents of children less than 6 months for whom exclusive breastfeeding is strongly recommended. In addition, since the timing of TTC implies that contact with service providers should be greatest when a child is under a year old, although some contact is expected after the first birthday as well, we test this by interacting a dummy variable for older children in the regressions that assess access to health services.</p><p xml:id="_bjM2HxV">All regressions include woreda level fixed effects (𝜎 𝑤 ) and adjust standard errors by clustering at the kebele level. The duration of the study ruled out child fixed effects or ANCOVA approaches for anthropometric outcomes since children who were in the baseline were older than 24 months by the endline<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">foot_7</ref> All models are intent to treat models estimated by OLS, using the randomized assignment for the identification of causal impact. The study design included twice as many kebeles in the EN treatment as in the CN treatment or the control group to allow for interaction of the EN treatment with the enhanced livelihood treatment.</p><p xml:id="_kYuNXeg">While we present individual outcomes, where appropriate we also report average standard treatment effects (ASTE) estimated for key families of outcomes, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007)</ref>. These are aggregated summaries of key outcomes of interest in a couple of tables, equivalent to outcomes presented in tables where all variables could be added up into a single measure. The ASTEs serve as summary indices that aggregate information over multiple outcomes and present effect sizes relative to the standard deviation of the control arm.</p><p xml:id="_PSzA68C">This aggregation improves statistical power to detect effects that go in the same direction within a domain. As this calculation requires that the signs of the coefficients all have the same welfare interpretation it is occasionally necessary to redefine the outcome for the purpose of computing an ASTE. We report ASTE for both nutrition programs as well as the two transfers, poultry, or cash. Where the dependent variable is a count itemeither knowledge scores or the number of food categories consumed -the total score serves in lieu of the ASTE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_GYmrbNP">Results</head><p xml:id="_gXFXqUr">Before presenting the results from the midline and endline surveys, Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows that the sample is well balanced across treatment arms in baseline characteristics. There are a few differences across treatment arms significant at p &lt;0.10, but these do not appear to be systematic in any direction. Moreover, there are no significant differences in the key anthropometry measures. These summary statistics provide an overview of the context at baseline. Households in the sample are poor; the low average of expenditures is consistent with the mean prevalence of poverty in the sample (below $1.90 per capita per day) of 45 percent. The kebeles are fairly remote at 11-14 km from the nearest town. Households are quite large, averaging 5.7 members.</p><p xml:id="_WWyuCZ9">Education levels are low, with only 1 in 5 women and 1 in 3 men having any education.</p><p xml:id="_aqfQzk2">Women's diets are limited, with only 3.4 percent of women meeting the standard for minimum dietary diversity <ref type="bibr">(FAO and USAID 2015)</ref>. Child diets are also severely limited, with index children aged 6-35 months consuming fewer than 2 food groups per day. Only 1.0 percent of these index children consumed a minimally acceptable diet (WHO and UNICEF 2017). Child malnutrition is a substantial public health problem in these communities: across the different treatment arms 36.2-39.7 percent of index children were stunted and 11.6-16.6 percent were wasted.</p><p xml:id="_5RqdJqr">As indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2a</ref> there is no indication that the SPIR program had a measurable impact on anthropometric status on average. Indeed, all the point estimates for the coefficients of EN in the table are close to zero. Although the sample of children 6-35 months is smaller than anticipated in the original design due to the delay in the endline survey caused by COVID precautions, alternative estimates with a larger sample of children 6-59 months, consistent in size with the original power calculations, also indicate no significant impacts on anthropometry overall.</p><p xml:id="_ewfFXDv">However, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2b</ref>, which focuses on a sample restricted to the extremely poor households in each kebele, provides experimental evidence on the impact of program subcomponents. While there was no observed improvement in anthropometry relative to the control among the extremely poor households in the kebeles that received enhanced nutrition but did not receive the livelihood grants, those that received cash transfers and the EN program had significantly higher height for age and reduced stunting. This combination of interventions reduced stunting by 18 percentage points, compared to the 54 percent of the extremely poor in the control group that was stunted. In contrast, cash transfers provided to households in the CN nutrition program did not lead to improvement in these outcomes. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">11</ref> We focus on this sample of extremely poor households in the results that follow to inform the mechanisms behind this finding. However, we return to a comparison of ASTE results for the extremely poor and less poor households which had no access to cash or poultry livelihoods support at the conclusion of the presentation of results on livelihood transfers.</p><p xml:id="_FQUWJV7">Does the limited impact reflect a deviation from the planned implementation of the program components in some treatment arms? The ASTEs reported in</p><p xml:id="_Wz3uShY">Table 3 indicate increased access to nutrition services for the extremely poor households. This improved access is across all the components of the ASTE for the kebeles receiving the EN nutrition program while the ASTE results for the households in CN arm are largely driven by increased participation in nutrition discussions within the VESAs. Unlike the results for stunting, the increase in service access observed in the EN program does not differ between the households receiving livelihood grants and those in the EN arms that were not provided grants. That is, there is no evidence that cash transfers drove increased health service utilization.</p><p xml:id="_WmTvGnP">Table 3 also indicates increased probabilities of attending community food demonstrations or attending a community BCC session as well as participating in water, sanitation, and hygiene meetings. The WASH activities indicated in columns 6 and 7 were offered in all treatment arms as well as in the control. The EN program, nevertheless, facilitated increases in participation in these activities, while the CN did not. Grants apparently had no complementary impact on participation. Column 8 indicates a substantial increase in the probability of discussing health and nutrition messages for both the EN and CN programs</p><p xml:id="_uCdV7vM">through the VESAs that were facilitated in all treatment arms of the intervention. However, unlike WASH activities, these were not organized in the control arm of the study.</p><p xml:id="_CDmWQW9">As shown by the ASTE in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref>, the EN program did not contribute to an increase in a suite of child specific health and nutrition activities. For example, there was no increase in the probability of a child being weighed or having their mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measured for all children less than 24 months. The age for which this information was obtained was more restricted than for family access to services in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">3</ref>. Children less than 6 months either were not expected to receive the services, as with vitamin A, or the 6-month recall did not apply fully. Thus, the table covers children 6-23 months. There is suggestive evidence of an increase in participation in recuperative child feeding involving cooking demonstrations in the EN arm mediated by cash transfers. The two-week cooking demonstrations and child feeding were provided to mothers whose children screened as underweight or at risk of malnutrition (based on MUAC) through weight screenings. Thus, they reflect the probability of being weighedwhich the program hopes to increaseas well as the probability of being undernourishedwhich the program desired to decreaseas well as the take up of the CPNP offer. Participation in these recuperative child feeding sessions required mothers to supply the ingredients for the meals being prepared each day, suggesting a plausible pathway for an interaction effect with cash transfers.</p><p xml:id="_XtcEFM3">Table 5 indicates that there was an insignificant increase in maternal knowledge in the EN treatment areas. The average total increase in the knowledge score in EN kebeles offering grants of 0.154 reported in column 1 measures the sum of the 7 questions on nutritional knowledge. This effect is less than a 4 percent of the mean score for the control population despite the EN arms receiving grants and having increased contact with HEW and HDA workers as well as participation in facilitated discussions on nutrition in the VESA meetings. This compares to the similarly modest effect of 0.226 (6.6 percent) on having attended any school.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">foot_9</ref> </p><p xml:id="_JRtd28X">The overall EN program also contributed to an increase in the maternal diet diversity score (column 1 of Table <ref type="table">6</ref>), which is based on the sum of results in columns 3-12, as well as in the share or women meeting the guideline for minimum diet diversity. The increase in MDD among women receiving poultry of 0.044 is small, yet it is a 77 percent increase over the value in the control communities, reflecting the very poor quality of diets among mothers in the study.</p><p xml:id="_5aayBTx">However, as in the results on the nutrition knowledge score, there is no significant difference if the EN community was randomized to receive grants or only the enhanced nutrition intervention.</p><p xml:id="_2nSBHcB">Nor was there an increase in the CN communities.</p><p xml:id="_cch5VR6">Nevertheless, a similar increase in the diversity of diets for children 6-23 months was not observed on average in the EN arms although this was a key focus of the IYCF training (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>). There was also no overall change in the share of children consuming at least five of eight food groups daily, including breast milk, which is the recommended minimum diet diversity (MDD) for a child of 6-24 months (WHO and UNICEF, 2017). Virtually no child in the sample met this guideline. In addition to MDD, the guideline for a minimal acceptable diet includes minimum meal frequency, defined as proportion of children aged 6-23 months who receive solid, semi-solid, or soft foods at least two (three) times for children aged 6-8 (9-23) months.</p><p xml:id="_AnASTpm">While over 44 percent of the children in the control group were fed in accord with this guideline, the SPIR nutrition programs by themselves did not lead to any increase in the share who were provided meals at a frequency that is keeping with the recommendation.</p><p xml:id="_YQU6scR">However, children in households within the EN arms of the study that were randomized to receive poultry grants did see an increase in the diet diversity score. This was driven, in part, by an increase in the frequency of egg consumption but also milk intake. This was not the case in other households within EN program arms. Despite the higher probability of both egg and dairy consumption among children in kebeles randomized for poultry grants, there is no significant difference between these kebeles and those selected for cash in the nutritional outcomes report in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2b</ref>. The diet diversity scores, however, do not report quantities consumed nor is the sample designed to assess heterogeneity by child age which maps with the duration of program coverage.</p><p xml:id="_EBaPA5S">Previous work has shown that such in-kind assistance in combination with BCC has a different impact on egg consumption than equivalent cash in these villages <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alderman et al. 2022)</ref>. This is consistent with market imperfections that make consumption decisions not separable from production decisions, a special case of agricultural household models, albeit not a rare one. As the short run response to an in-kind grant may differ from longer term behavior, the key results on the dietary impact in the endline are compared to the previous midline results using the published specification. These are reported in Annex 1.</p><p xml:id="_vnxyjse">The diet diversity tables for both mothers and for children include a dummy variable for religious fasting days in Orthodox households. These indicate a significant reduction in the probability of consuming dairy, meat, and eggs with little corresponding increase in other food groups among adult women. Fasting among Orthodox households did not affect dairy consumption by children in keeping with previous evidence (D <ref type="bibr">'Haene et al., 2020)</ref>. This likely reflects the fact that cows provide milk according to their own biology and the milk is not easily stored. In contrast, the timing of animal purchases or slaughtering is at the household's discretion.</p><p xml:id="_Jwbmvuf">In Table <ref type="table">8</ref>, we provide a summary of ASTEs or aggregate impact for each family of outcomes by receipt of EN and CN for the extremely poor and less poor samples. These do not focus on the nature of livelihood grants but are relevant for understanding the overall impact of SPIR on nutrition. Results show that the only significant difference in program response between the extremely poor and the less poor is in the results on stunting. While this may be partially due to the significant complementarity of cash transfers and the EN intervention, it also reflects the unexpectedbut statistically insignificant -increase in stunting among the less poor. The marginally significant differences between overall EN and CN ASTE results among the extremely poor in columns 5 and 6 were not observed in tables 6 and 7. This is because the tests in Table <ref type="table">8</ref> include extremely poor households who were not randomized for grants. This adds a subsample that was no less responsive than the EN response among grant recipients and in so doing increases the sample size. In each case where the EN results differed from CN results for the extremely poor, including the substantial ASTE results on access to health care, they also differed for the less poor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_fMFB4PY">Concluding Discussion</head><p xml:id="_JhG2Dk7">The livelihood cash grants were designed to encourage asset formation and had no intrinsic features specifically tied to access to or utilization of enhanced health and nutrition services. There was, however, complementarity of cash and enhanced nutrition for the anthropometric outcomes, even though this was not seen in diet diversity. This leaves a puzzle as to the actual mechanism of the complementarity of cash and nutritional services. Plausibly the recipients of cash were able to purchase more food. The diet diversity index does not measure changes in quantities only the probability that a food group was included in the daily diet. Also, cash recipients were more likely to participate in the CPNP recuperative child feeding sessions, perhaps drawing upon the cash to provide the expected food inputs in this two-week program.</p><p xml:id="_V5MwPvU">Thus, the overall results provide a basis for tempered nutritional outcome expectations for this additional support to extremely poor households, valued at well over one year of transfers in the PSNP, when combined with enhanced nutrition programming.</p><p xml:id="_w8B8a7C">The grant of poultry did enhance the EN program in regard to the inclusion of eggs in a child's diet, but this was not sufficient to have a significant impact on height for age. The challenge to the advocacy of household poultry production as a means to foster better child nutrition may hinge on the ability to sustain flocks. The susceptibility of the birds to illness was noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Passarelli et al. (2022)</ref> in a similar program in Ethiopia. However, the final SPIR survey did not report on the number of birds that died. The survey did ascertain the number of birds sold in the previous 12 months; poultry grant recipients sold, on average, two more birds than their neighbors. Due to the delay in data collection necessitated by COVID the time between surveys was greater than the 12 months recall so there is a possibility that sales in this period partially accounts for the convergence of flock size between in-kind grant recipients and their counterparts. Nevertheless, the potential to enhance consumption of animal source foods with these transfers did not prove to be sustainable (Annex 1).</p><p xml:id="_m9dP99R">The clearest evidence of the impact of the EN treatment distinct from the complementarity with grants was shown in the increase of contact between mothers of young children and service providers despite the challenges of COVID as well as the improvement in women's IYCF knowledge. Within the kebeles, the overall probability of any mother meeting with a HEW or member of the HDA in the previous 3 months increased from the pre-COVID midline (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). Still, even though the contact in EN communities was 28 percent above the 43 percent rate of contact for mothers in the control it was not sufficient to improve anthropometric indicators of child nutrition status. This likely reflects the fact that the frequency of contact with health service providers (either HEWs or HDA volunteers) still fell well short of intent. Although the TTC model envisions 11 home visits in the first 1,000 days after conception, the endline survey revealed that approximately only a quarter of mothers of children under 12 months in the EN communities reported a home visit in the last 3 months and this probability declined for older children.</p><p xml:id="_thTFYJn">This contrasts with an average of 2 visits in the last 3 months in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim et al. (2020)</ref> and likely accounts for the larger impact measured in that study. However, there is a positive association of HAZ and program participation for children whose household reported having received a home visit recently. This hints at the possibility that more frequent service provision might have more favorable impacts, but it does not give any indication as to how this intensification may be achieved. As the current study cannot assess the determinants of home visits by HEW or HDA volunteers, this can be considered a limitation of the study and an area for future research.</p><p xml:id="_SWzmZBU">Restricting the sample in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2a</ref> to the 598 young children in the households that reported they had contact with a HEW or HDA in the preceding three monthsa selected subsample that is potentially biased towards larger impactsfinds an increase in HAZ of 0.286 (SE=0.163) and a reduction of stunting of -0.082 (SE=0.045). Both these increases are significant at 10 percent level, while lower statistical power than the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2a</ref> is expected as the regressions are filtered to have a smaller sample. A further restriction of the sample to the 253 households where the HEW or a HDA visited at the household indicated much larger point estimates of improvements in HAZ and reduction in stunting, 0.616 (SE=0.275) and -0.165 (SE=0.072) respectively, with both of these estimates significant at 5 percent level. While the unknown nature of the selectivity into this subsample, possibly due to better trained staff and supervisors or more motivated mothers or both, makes these results only suggestive at best, they may provide guidance for future inclusion of nutrition within the PSNP.</p><p xml:id="_SxEzuV6">Drilling down further, results indicate that contact with HEW or HDA workers in the EN program was concentrated among households with children less than a year old. The increase for all extremely poor households with these young infants is 25 percentage points higher than the 47 percent share of contact for corresponding households with children in that age group in the control group (results not shown). While the net increase in contact with a HEW or HDA when the youngest child was less than twelve months was significant at p &lt; 0.01, the overall increase</p><p xml:id="_628Dwzn">for the extremely poor households within the EN communities for children 12-23 months is only 0.030 [SE=0.0820.189-0.116] and not significant. While the less intensive CN intervention led to increased participation in community events relative to the control, it did not lead to increased contact with government health staff or volunteers, nor increased women's IYCF knowledge or dietary diversity. Even though women in the CN arm reported the inclusion of nutrition topics in VESAs similar to those in EN, all the increases in contact with health service providers in the EN program were larger than those in CN at P &lt; 0.1. This difference likely explains the absence of an impact on mother's knowledge score or her diet diversity in the CN program, outcomes that were influenced by the EN arm of the study. Despite the increased nutritional knowledge amongst women as well as changes in their diets, there was not a clear impact on dietary diversity for young children in the EN program. This remains extremely low. Hirvonen et al. (2021) document late introduction of solid and semi-solid foods in Ethiopia which is linked to lower length for age of young children. In the current study, 26 percent of the children 6-8 months consumed no other food than breastmilk in the previous day indicated in the list of 25 foods in the appropriate IYCF module for diet diversity.</p><p xml:id="_kU38Ss5">Thus, in conclusion, the success in enhancing coverage of nutrition services to lowincome mothers in remote areas can be considered a partial achievement of the SPIR program. It remains, however, a challenge to maximize the nutritional impact of this service delivery.</p><p xml:id="_Qp3ugEh">Livelihood grants make a modest contribution to the challenge, but in the longer run, it is a larger task to build upon this contribution.

(2022)</ref> with the endline impact a year and a half later. The specification replicates the earlier results using the full sample including a supplementary sample added at midline to refresh the sample of children less than 24 months. Thus, the specification differs slightly from the results presented in the main text. The opportunity to return to the initial results indicates that the significant increase in egg consumption for all households eligible for poultry grants that was observed at midline is no longer apparent. This is likely driven by the fact that at midlineless than 6 months after the grants were distributedpoultry recipients had 7.5 more birds than household that did not receive the transfer including those who had a cash grant of equivalent value.</p><p xml:id="_RUNeQqE">Two years after the grants were disbursed this difference had declined to only 1.5 birds, although the increase in poultry owned remained statistically significant (column 8).

USAID's Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) supported the PSNP4 in selected woredas (districts) through the Strengthen PSNP4 Institutions and Resilience (SPIR) graduation program. In addition to supporting implementation of PSNP4 SPIR also provided additional complementary livelihood, nutrition, gender, and natural resource management activities led by World Vision in partnership with the Organization for Rehabilitation and Development (ORDA) and CARE. SPIR targeted more than 500,000 PNSP clients in 15 of the most vulnerable woredas in Amhara and Oromia regions of Ethiopia and provided community-level programming and capacity building of government staff involved in public service delivery at the woreda (district) and kebele (subdistrict) level. The trial included three treatment arms and a control group. One treatment arm provided a package of enhanced nutrition (EN) services including support for household-level BCC, recuperative feeding for acutely malnourished children, promotion of male engagement in household tasks, and group therapy for mothers screened for depressive symptoms. A subset of the poorest beneficiaries within this arm also received an additional one-time grant either in cash or as poultry assets as a part of the enhanced livelihood program component. A second treatment arm provided the enhanced livelihood program treatment with a less intensive and less costly core nutrition service (CN). A third treatment arm provided the same enhanced package of nutrition services as the first treatment arm but without the enhanced livelihood program including grants. All three treatment arms also provided a set of core services including promotion of savings and access to credit through Village Economic and Social Associations (VESAs).</figDesc></figure>

Similarly, father is used in lieu of primary male caregiver irrespective of biological roles.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8" xml:id="foot_6"><p xml:id="_uu4J9Y3">A supplemental sample of households was added at midline to refresh the age-appropriate sample for aspects of analysis of nutrition such as dietary diversity of children in keeping with IYCF norms. This sample was drawn from the original beneficiary lists that were used for the baseline household sample with the same eligibility criteria as in the baseline, with the exception being that children must be under 2 years old at the time of the survey. The midline survey aimed to add 4 supplemental households in each kebele (another 768 households). As the supplemental sample did not receive any livelihood grants that are the main focus of this paper, that sample is not included in the main body of this study. Results including the supplemental households, however, are presented in Annex Table3.</p></note>

In principle, it would be possible to have a child level panel of anthropometric measures using data collected for children up to 60 months. Similarly, we could not use a panel on child health care since this was collected only for children &lt; 24 months and thus did not cover the initial child sample by the endline.</p></note>

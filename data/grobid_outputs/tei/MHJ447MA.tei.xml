<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_3RyrxuG">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_QSBH5aj">Child labor has drawn a considerable attention in recent public policies and research studies because of its violation of basic human rights and its long-term negative consequences on household economic growth and child development outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Edmonds 2008)</ref>. It can reduce children current educational achievement as well as future income potential. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Beegle, Dehejia, and Gatti (2005)</ref> analysed a panel data from Vietnam and compared educational outcomes of children who are involved with market work and studies versus those who only study. They find that an additional hour of work decreases the probability that a child will be in school after five years by three percentage points. They also find that it declines approximately twenty-two days' grade attainment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ilahi, Orazem, and Sedlacek (2000)</ref> observe wage rates of eighteen plus year workers in Brazil and find that the wage rate is 13 to 17% lower for those who entered the labor market before thirteen years compared to those who entered in later ages.</p><p xml:id="_EfmTyk8">Household asset holdings and standards of living are key determinants of child labor along with other factors, for example, parents' education and social norms. Some studies show that child labor decreases with household asset holding <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Blunch and Verner 2001)</ref> while other studies show that child labor can increase with asset holding <ref type="bibr">(Gautam and Sarangi 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Bhalotra and Heady 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, and Rogers and Swinnerton 2004)</ref>. One of the main challenges in determining the causal relationship between child labor and asset holdings is that poor households differ from rich households, which brings potential omitted factors biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Edmonds 2005)</ref>. Some studies use variation in household income excluding the child income, and others use instrumental variable approach. Both methods have their own limitations. The first approach does not deal with the joint determination of asset holding/living standard and child activity choices. The validity of the second approach largely depends on a strong assumption that the instrument is related to asset holdings but has no direct effect child labor, an assumption which is unlikely to hold in many cases. Therefore, it is ideal to study child labor and household asset holding with some exogenous variation in asset level.</p><p xml:id="_HBprJG9">We use data set from a large scale randomized control trial (RCT) experiment to study the relationship between household asset holdings and child labor in Bangladesh. The program transfers livestock assets and subsistence allowances to very poor households with an objective to transform the economics life of the households. Similar programs have been implemented in a number of others countries as well and research studies have shown positive impacts of asset transfer on different dimensions of household well-being such as food security, consumption, self-employment activities, cash savings, per capita income, and psychological status of the targeted households (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hulme and Moore 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Emran et al 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, Asadullah, and Ara 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Hossain et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Bandiera et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Bauchet et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, and Banerjee et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_vuhDsq7">Although few studies explore the effect of randomized asset transfer intervention on child time allocation, their findings are not conclusive. <ref type="bibr">Benerjee et al. (2015)</ref> find no significant effect of the asset transfer on the child time allocation in India, they rather find an opposite result than ours, the children in the treatment group studies 30-40 more minutes per day compared to the control group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bauchet et al. (2015)</ref> assess the impact of the asset transfer on aggregate labor supply time of both the adult members and the children in various activities and find no significant evidence in productive activities, leisure, and household chores and find a significant effect in animal tending, and wage labor activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sulaiman (2015)</ref> explores the effect of asset transfer on child school enrollment using the same data as ours. He finds that the program intervention has no effect on school enrollment, but has a positive effect on household educational expenditure. He also finds that the program has a short-term impact on child working hour related to livestock rearing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bandiera et al. (2016)</ref> find that child working hour has increased in livestock rearing and land cultivation after an asset transfer in Bangladesh.</p><p xml:id="_kxX5euy">Our study exploits the RCT set up to estimate the program impact on child labor indicators, specifically, we assess the program impact on child work time in various activities including livestock and study. We use the Difference in Difference (DID) estimation method to estimate the program impact on child labor. We find that program intervention has a significantly increased child working hours in livestock activity; children in the treatment group work more than double in livestock activity. A large portion of total hours in livestock activity comes at the cost of study time.</p><p xml:id="_YWSmmu8">Whether the children work out of curiosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Sulaiman 2015)</ref> or for an economic reason after an asset transfer intervention is an important issue yet to be explored. If children have enough leisure time after or before their study time, they could engage in livestock rearing without hampering their study and at the same time can help their parents in productive activities. Another important argument about child work related to livestock rearing is whether a child works because the targeted women cannot move outside of homestead area due to social norms or not. If the targeted women cannot move outside of home freely, they are more likely to ask their children to take care of livestock for herding. We check how much of child working hours in livestock rearing is driven by household income from livestock activity. For the second objective, we estimate how much of total child working hour can be explained by the mobility index of the targeted women. We use a sequential g-estimation following <ref type="bibr">Achariya et al. (2016)</ref> and estimate the Average Controlled Direct Effect (ACDE) of the intervention. Our results show that only small fraction of a total child working hour (around 20%)in livestock activity can be explained by income from the livestock sector. We also find an interesting result for mobility index of the targeted women; our result shows that due high mobility index of the targeted women, child worked fewer hours than then they need do in case of low mobility index. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Edmonds (2008)</ref> describes four points supporting that child labor might decrease with household income. First, child labor is seen as a bad preference from the parental side; this is similar to the "Luxury axiom" concept proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Basu and Van (1998)</ref>. Second, the utility of marginal income from child work falls. Third, with higher income households can afford to hire labor from market to substitute child labor. Finally, fourth, the opportunity cost of forgone schooling increases with household income as child productivity in schooling activities is positively related to income. A similar argument might hold for asset ownership as household asset holding is a good proxy of household permanent income.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_WSt6kNq">Asset transfer, child labor, and Inverted-U hypothesis</head><p xml:id="_qGXGt32">However, the previous points by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Edmonds (2008)</ref> also depend on other factors. For example, increased income can increase household participation in more income generating activities which not necessarily decrease child labor. Del Carpio, Loayza, and Wada (2016) point out three factors that might increase child labor when households own productive asset.</p><p xml:id="_drhYNRR">First, hired labor is not a perfect substitute for family labor because of the risks of moral hazard, shirking, and theft <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Deolalikar and Vijverberg, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Foster and Rosenzweig, 1994)</ref>. Second, labor markets may be rigid in rural areas, especially for farm related activities. Third, in some cases, child labor are seen more about enhancing work experience, discipline, and human capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beegle et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Edmonds 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rogers, and Swinnerton, 2008)</ref>. Gender dynamics also play a role, for example, <ref type="bibr">Gautam and Sarangi (2005)</ref> find that the probability of being child labor differs between boys and girl in Malawi. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bhalotra and Heady (2003)</ref> find that girls bear heavier burdens of works compared to boys.</p><p xml:id="_DazTx3S">In the context of our program intervention, livestock asset along with subsistence allowance are transferred to the very poor households to lift-up poor women from low productive and wage labor activities. This will bring dynamics in their current activity choices of the targeted women and also of other household members. Child work hour may increase for a number of reasons such as, first, targeted women may continue working in their previous activities, second, targeted women work hour is not enough to take care of livestock and household cannot afford hiring a labor from market, third, livestock needs herding work that typically women cannot do because of social norms which restrict women's movement in going outside of home in Bangladesh, fourth, targeted female participate in economics activates which require rest of the family members, especially children, to work in household chores, and fifth, household might think that children participation in work will make them more disciplined and productive. All these factors will push children to work more and spend less time in study. BRAC follows a three-stage procedure to identify the participant households in the program. At the first stage, BRAC identifies the poorest districts and sub-districts of Bangladesh using World Food Program (WFP) poverty mapping for Bangladesh. Within each sub-district, the poorest communities are selected in consultation with BRAC staff. In the second stage, a participatory community wealth ranking is formed to identify the poorest household in each cluster. More specifically, communities are divided into clusters of 80-120 households and all the households in each cluster are ranked based on wealth holdings in a participatory approach. All households in the bottom 2/3 categories, termed as "communitydefined ultra-poor", are selected for the next stage. In the third and final stage, all the selected households are surveyed to identify who meets at least three out of five inclusion conditions and none of the exclusion conditions. Finally, under the inclusion and exclusion conditions, households are selected for program participation. Inclusion criteria are as follows: a household is dependent on female domestic work or begging, holds less than 10 decimals of land, has no adult active male member, school-aged children are engaged in paid work, or possesses no productive work. Exclusion criteria are as follows: household has no active adult women, is not a microfinance participant, or is not a beneficiary of government or non-government development project.</p></div>

We can control K and an interaction of K with treatment indicator in equation 1, which will indicate how of the program effect have worked through K . However, one major problem of such a regression model is that K is a post-treatment variable; that is K is also affected by the program intervention. Therefore, it will generate biased estimation as both the post-treatment variable and the child labor variable can be determined by a same unobservable factor(s) not included in the regression model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Acharya et al.

Children aged between 5 to 10 are usually studying at primary level who require less time in school and to study compared to the student at the secondary level (aged 10 to 16). Results are shown in table 3 in panel A and B, respectively.

Table <ref type="table">3</ref> also shows that impacts are much higher for the children aged between 10-14 years for similar activities.

Results also show that the targeted female increase their time allocation in agricultural self-employment activities and decrease in servant/maid related works in the long-run. A similar result is also noticeable for other working members as presented in table 6.

Table <ref type="table">6</ref> also shows that other working members also increased their time allocation in non-agricultural self-employment activities and decreased study time both in the medium term and long term.

Column 1 and 2 show effect for all the children and the subsequent column shows the result for children at primary, secondary, boys, and girls, respectively. Our results show that after subtracting out the effect of livestock income, the CFPR intervention still has a large impact on child labor. Specifically, our results show that 80% of total impact can be explained by non-economic factors and only 20% of the impact are due to income from livestock activity in the midline. The contribution of the economic reason has increased in the long run as expected; 50% of the total impact are due to economic reason in the long run. We get similar and consistent results for children at primary and secondary level. The same argument also holds for boys are girls except that girls work in livestock only for non-economic reason in the long-run.</p><p xml:id="_sTR8jQ8">Table <ref type="table">8</ref> shows how much of the total effect of the CFPR intervention can be explained by mobility index of the targeted female.

As a result, children in the treatment group needed to work fewer hours compared to the scenario where the CFPR intervention has no effect on mobility. Our results show that the effect of the CFPR could have been 184 hours per year instead of 83 hours in midline had there is no improvement in mobility of the targeted female.</p><p xml:id="_aHBjNfz">Similarly, total impact could have been 117 hours instead of 51 hours in the end-line.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_JYsgSM3">Conclusion</head><p xml:id="_nbjCrCh">Asset transfer programs are largely successful in transforming the livelihoods of the "ultrapoor" household in terms of occupational change, asset holdings, consumption, and food security, unlike the other microfinance programs that largely fail to generate strong positive evidence on borrowers' welfare (see Benerjee at al. 2015 for details). It works as a big push for the "ultra-poor" households to overcome the poverty traps. However, such an opportunity also induce household to employ their children in working activities to reduce production cost and maximize household earnings. Social norms sometimes hinder women movement outside of the homestead area which can also cause an increase in child labor.</p><p xml:id="_beM9XQW">Our finding shows evidence of increased children's working hours after the asset transfer and importantly reduce children study time in some cases. Children who get involved in working activities once might continue their works for the longer term and shift to more income generating activities in the future. Such early involvements can bring long-term negative consequences on human capital, health, and economics outcomes of the household. It is, therefore, important to introduce additional incentive packages in the asset transfer intervention that will discourage the "ultra-poor" households to involve their children in working activities.

The TUP program was built on BRAC's experiences with the Income Generation for Vulnerable Group Development (IGVGD) program launched jointly by BRAC and the World Food Programme (WFP) in 1985. The IGVGD program transferred food and provided skill training to very poor households. Although it was successful in increasing income of the participant households, it failed to generate sustainable impacts (Hashemi 2001), suffered from targeting problems, and program service packages were ineffective (Ahmed et al. 2009). Based on the lessons from the IGVGD program, BRAC introduced TUP, which introduced productive asset transfers and an overhauled targeting strategy. The second phase of the program was initiated in 40 districts in 2007 named as Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction (CFPR). The program transfers livestock assets such as cows, goats, and chickens to households with an average value of USD 140. The program also provides training and support for better utilization of the transferred assets. The program also provides subsistence allowances during the first 40 weeks to compensate for any shortfalls in income that might happen because of the occupational shift of the targeted female. The program transfers assets in six different combinations of either one or two types of livestock. Participants are encouraged to retain the transferred asset for at least two years, however, they can exchange current assets for other income generating assets during this period. Skill training includes an initial classroom training, weekly visit of BRAC staff for the first two years, and monthly or bi-monthly visits of livestock specialists for the first year (Bandiera et al. 2013).</figDesc></figure>

Finally, the poorest communities from each branch are selected for the experiment. The final evaluation covers 20 sub-district, 40 branches, and 1,409 communities. The original experiment uses information of 7,953 eligible households to evaluate the effect of the CFPR intervention. All the households are interviewed in 2007, 2009, and 2011.</figDesc></figure>

Children in the control group work on average 41 hours in livestock activity in the midline, which is almost 212% less compared to the children in the treatment group.

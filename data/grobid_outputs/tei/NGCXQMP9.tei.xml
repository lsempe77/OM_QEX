A substantial literature in economics and other disciplines has demonstrated that such shocks are largely uninsured across rural areas in lowand middle-income countries, 1 and thus adverse rainfall and temperature shocks may force households to cut back on their consumption or sell assets, worsening their food security and increasing their vulnerability to chronic poverty. 2 In addition, droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events may have disproportionate negative effects on women in these contexts because they have reduced intrahousehold access to resources and face greater health disparities <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(van Daalen et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Björkman-Nyqvist 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Dercon and Krishnan 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Corno, Hildebrandt, and Voena 2020)</ref>.

Strengthen PSNP4 Institutions and Resilience (SPIR) was a five-year project delivering bundled livelihoods, nutrition, and gender interventions to PSNP beneficiaries, centered around the formation of village economic and social associations (VESAs) as a platform for livelihoods and nutrition programming; in some arms, there was also a one-time livelihoods transfer targeting the poorest beneficiaries. Importantly, the set of livelihood interventions and transfer amounts were considerably smaller in scope than in wellknown graduation model programs originally designed by BRAC and evaluated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Banerjee et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bandiera et al. (2017)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_nnHU9gB">The multi-arm RCT was designed to evaluate combinations of four interventions: core livelihood activities and core nutrition activities as well as enhanced versions of both types of activities. Prior reporting of results from this experiment showed that SPIR had positive impacts on domains such as livestock-related production, financial inclusion, and access to health services, but no significant impacts on consumption or poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Leight et al. 2023)</ref>, suggesting a more limited response to this light-touch graduation approach on average than in graduation programs providing larger transfers.</p><p xml:id="_DSTvMbt">There was also, in general, no evidence of significant effects on children's anthropometrics in a context of widespread stunting <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Alderman et al. 2023)</ref>. However, the impacts on savings and access to credit were comparable to the literature evaluating BRAC-implemented programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Banerjee et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bandiera et al. 2017)</ref> and visible both at the midline and endline <ref type="bibr">(Leight et al., 2023)</ref>. This finding is promising in terms of resilience given that higher levels of savings among low-income households can impact their ability to manage risks more effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Pomeranz and Kast 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Karlan et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_gBpfC6p">We map detailed satellite data on weather events to the experiment's household survey data to understand whether and how this light-touch graduation program protected households against the effects of droughts. Our identification relies on exogenous variation in program exposure induced by the cluster RCT coupled with both longitudinal and cross-sectional variation in drought incidence over the three survey rounds conducted between 2016 and 2021. 4 Our primary measure of drought is constructed using the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Vicente-Serrano, Beguería, and López-Moreno (2010)</ref> and it captures relative dryness experienced in the sample areas as any negative deviation relative to the long-term mean; in other words, we examine even moderate fluctuations in dryness, as distinct from extreme weather anomalies. 5   Our findings suggest that even these moderate changes in relative dryness during the main cropping season cause statistically significant and economically meaningful fluctuations in household welfare as well as women's health and welfare, specifically. To assess the magnitude of the coefficients of interest, we evaluate the effects of a 0.25 standard deviation (SD) increase in relative dryness defined relative to the locality-specific long-term mean; this corresponds roughly to the median increase in relative dryness observed in drought-affected areas, 0.23 SD. In communities of the control arm not served by SPIR, a drought of this magnitude leads to a 36 percent increase in self-reported food insecurity (the food gap) and a 35 percent decrease in aggregated livestock holdings. Focusing on variables capturing effects on women's health and human capital specifically, there is also some suggestive evidence that droughts have an adverse effect on women's dietary diversity and BMI, and substantial evidence of increased risk of intimate partner violence: a 0.25 SD increase in relative dryness increases the risk of intimate partner violence by 21 percent, consistent with previous literature (Díaz and Saldarriaga 2023; Epstein et   4 Related work in this area has mainly relied on cross-sectional variation in weather or other type of shocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Macours, Premand, and Vakis 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Karlan et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Emerick et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Pomeranz and Kast 2022)</ref>, but given high spatial correlation in weather shocks, an analysis relying solely on cross-sectional variation may confront limited power. Accordingly, we argue that exploiting substantial longitudinal variation is a meaningful strength of our empirical design. 5 We follow a number of recent papers in using the SPEI as a primary measure to capture weather shocks, including <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Harari and La Ferrara (2018)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Webb (2023)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Maystadt, Calderone, and You (2015)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Couttenier and Soubeyran (2014)</ref>. al. 2020; Abiona and Koppensteiner 2018). While we lack consumption data from all survey rounds, evidence based on the endline data only shows that a past drought in the magnitude of 0.25 SD results in a 5 percent fall in control household's consumption.</p><p xml:id="_M7x4VsV">However, the corresponding effects of these drought shocks are either partially or completely muted in households that resided in clusters that received SPIR programming. In drought-affected clusters served by SPIR, the increase in the food gap is roughly half the magnitude of the increase observed in drought-affected clusters in the control arm, while the decline in livestock holdings is less than a third of the corresponding decline in drought-affected control clusters; and drought does not lead to any significant increase in IPV at all in clusters served by SPIR. Similarly, the impacts on household consumption seem completely muted in treated households. These findings indicate that the livelihood interventions protected households and especially women during droughts, over and above the support received through the existing safety net program, the PSNP.</p><p xml:id="_c8Jteuf">Further analysis of the mechanisms for these effects suggests that there is little evidence of any heterogeneity across different SPIR treatment arms that offered different combinations of interventions; rather, the primary mechanism seems to be a substantial relative increase in savings that is attributable to the establishment of VESAs and observed consistently among all households served by SPIR (including those who did not receive one-time cash or poultry transfers). In the face of a drought shock, treated households then use this enhanced stock of savings as a means to mitigate the impact of the shock, allowing them to smooth consumption and partially protect productive (livestock) assets.</p><p xml:id="_zDZ3HZK">Our study expands upon the extensive body of literature examining the negative impact of extreme weather events on household wellbeing. We add evidence for an extremely poor population (nearly two thirds of households were below the extreme poverty line) where severe droughts have contributed to starvation and long-term poverty in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(De Waal 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Dercon and Porter 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Webb and von Braun 1994)</ref> but during a period when droughts were less severe, reflecting a more typical year-to-year variation in drought stress in this context. To date, a considerably smaller literature has tested applicable interventions to build household resilience against extreme weather events. 6 A small but growing body of research shows that safety net programs can, at least partly, mitigate the negative impacts of extreme weather events and other natural disasters (Adhvaryu et al. 2023; De Janvry et al. 2006; Hou 2010; Premand and Stoeffler 2020; Knippenberg   and Hoddinott 2017; Christian et al. 2019; Asfaw et al. 2017). 7   Importantly, our study is one of the first to test whether popular graduation model programs make households resilient to drought shocks, building on Macours, Premand, and Vakis (2022) who offered complementary livelihood interventions to short-term safety net program beneficiaries in rural Nicaragua. Our findings are similar in that we also find that simple cash transfers (offered to the control arm via the PSNP itself) are insufficient to buffer households against droughts, while a bundled model of interventions effectively assists households in coping with shocks. However, the relevant mechanisms are notably different. In their context, the complementary interventions vocational training or productive grantshelped households to diversify into non-agricultural activities, and thus protected them against the negative impacts of weather shocks on agricultural income. In our context, diversification into non-agricultural activities is virtually non-existent: less than 5% of sample households in the control arm report any non-agricultural business or regular wage employment at endline, and there is no evidence of any meaningful treatment effect of SPIR on these outcomes. Rather, as noted above, the main mechanism seems to be via buffer stock savings. Overall, these findings are encouraging because they suggest that even relatively lighttouch interventions (without one-off transfers) can promote resilience within the context of an existing safety net program, and even in a context of minimal off-farm income-generating opportunities.</p><p xml:id="_CB7pWAT">Finally, we contribute to the growing body of literature unpacking the differential effects of drought shocks and other weather shocks on women, and particularly the literature analysing the impact of negative and positive income shocks on intimate partner violence.

At the household level, food security, consumption, and/or assets are typically employed to analyze the effects of weather-related shocks such as droughts on economic welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Macours, Premand, and Vakis 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Carpena 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kazianga and Udry 2006)</ref>. However, to capture whether the adverse effects of droughts are uniquely salient for women, it is arguably most informative to use measures of women's nutritional and health status, given that measuring individual-level consumption in extremely poor rural households is challenging. In addition, we generally constrain our analysis to focus on variables that were consistently measured in all three survey rounds, though we will present some supplementary analysis around one key variable (consumption) that was not measured at midline.</p><p xml:id="_jPWzwCj">First, as a measure of household level food security, we use a construct called the "food gap".</p><p xml:id="_PJuNupj">Employed as the main food security indicator in PSNP evaluations, the food gap is measured by asking survey participants to report the number of months, out of the preceding 12 months, that they had "problems satisfying the food needs of the household". <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">11</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Knippenberg and Hoddinott (2017)</ref> show how a (self-reported) drought shock increases food gap by 1.6 months among PSNP households.

First, large livestock (bulls, oxen) can be used as draft power during ploughing and threshing <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Mekuriaw and Harris-Coble 2021)</ref>. Second, livestock products (e.g., dairy, eggs, meat) provide additional income to agrarian households. Third, as access to formal savings institutions remains highly limited in rural areas, livestock is an important form of savings that can be liquidated during droughts and other shocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Fafchamps, Udry, and Czukas 1998)</ref>. Our measure of livestock holdings is based on tropical livestock units (TLUs). 12   The average household in the control cluster owned 0.97 TLUs at the baseline, including on average 0.6 heads of cattle (bull, oxen, or cow), 0.3 pack animals (donkey or mule), 0.5 sheep/goat and 1.5 chickens.</p><p xml:id="_yBaKNtf">To measure women's individual exposure to drought shocks, we use three variables. First, we assess dietary diversity among women. 13 The survey instrument was administered to the primary female in the household, who was identified as the mother or primary caregiver of an index child aged 0-35 months. Following the FAO and FHI 360 (2016) guidelines, we construct a diet diversity index that counts the number of food groups consumed by the primary female in the 24 hours prior to the interview. In this index, foods with similar nutritional contents have been categorized into 10 food groups. Since the indicator has been validated for women who are 15 to 49 years of age, we restrict the sample to primary women in this age range when analyzing this outcome. After this restriction, the final data has 9,087 diet diversity observations across the three survey rounds, excluding 16% of observations. At the baseline, the average primary female in control households consumed only from 2.1 food groups.</p><p xml:id="_ApW8s8Y">As a second measure of women's individual-level welfare, we use data collected on the height and weight of the primary female to construct a body-mass index (BMI), which is computed by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of body height in meters. The BMI is considered a reasonable proxy for adult health risks <ref type="bibr">(Fogel, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr">, Waaler, 1984)</ref> and shown to be responsive to drought and other shocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Hoddinott and Kinsey 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Dercon and Krishnan 2000)</ref>. For the BMI analysis, we restrict the sample to women who are 15 to 49 years and exclude women with implausible BMI values (BMI below 15 or above 50). After these restrictions, we are left with 8,100 BMI observations across the three survey sounds, excluding 16% of observations. The mean BMI among primary females in control households at the baseline is 20.2. About 26 percent of the women in our sample are categorized as underweight (BMI&lt;18.5) at the baseline. 12 The standard measure of a TLU is one cattle with a body weight of 250 kg <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Jahnke 1982)</ref>. TLU are expressed as ratios relative to this standard unit, where the ratios are based on metabolic weights. So, for example, six sheep have the same energy requirements as one cattle and so six sheep translate into one TLU. Consequently, 1 sheep equals 0.15 TLU while 1 chicken is 0.01 TLU. 13 There is also some previous evidence that droughts reduce dietary diversity measured at the household level <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Carpena 2019)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_MWd6pXk">As a third individual-level variable, we also analyze women's recent experience of intimate partner violence, motivated in part by recent research examining the influence of drought or rainfall shocks on the risk of IPV <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Díaz and Saldarriaga 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Epstein et al. 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Abiona and Koppensteiner 2018)</ref>. All three survey rounds contained an IPV module, administered to the primary female in accordance with the WHO protocol on ethical guidelines for conducting research on IPV (WHO 2016). As the module was administered only if the respondent reported living with her husband in the last 12 months and if she was alone or with a child less than 36 months at the time of the interview, 14 the sample size is smaller than for the other outcomes. 15 At baseline, 17 percent of the women in the control clusters reported to have experienced physical, sexual and/or emotional violence in the previous 12 months. While this pooled variable is our primary indicator relevant to IPV, we report our results separately for the three forms of IPV that were collected in the surveys (see Appendix A for definitions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_kzdVf46">Drought indicator</head><p xml:id="_fSZxuMq">We focus on meteorological droughts that are characterized by precipitation (rainfall) deficiencies that persist across a large geographical area for an extended duration (Van Loon 2015). 16 These deficiencies are potentially coupled with heightened potential evapotranspiration, in which reduced rainfall and higher temperatures contribute to greater evaporation of moisture from the air and more rapid transpiration of water from the soil by plants. Related empirical work in economics has traditionally used variation in local rainfall patterns as a proxy for droughts. However, temperature is a critical factor in meteorological drought, exacerbating water stress and evapotranspiration <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Vicente-Serrano, Beguería, and López-Moreno 2010)</ref>. Consequently, contemporary drought indicators integrate both precipitation and temperature data, thus 14 Very few eligible women refused to respond to the IPV questions. 15 At the baseline, 2,136 women responded to the IPV module, at the midline 1,648 women, and at the endline 2,161 women. An error in the CAPI program in the midline survey led to the IPV questions being excluded from the survey administered to about 600 women. All women who reported violence were given the option to be referred to the Women's Affairs Committee in her district. 16 There are at least three other inter-related drought concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Van Loon 2015)</ref>. Hydrological drought refers to deficits in both surface and subsurface water resources. Soil moisture (or agricultural) drought is linked to reduced supply of moisture to plants. Socio-economic drought captures the socio-economic impacts of droughts. An important distinction here is that meteorological, hydrological or soil moisture droughts do not necessarily translate into socioeconomic droughts if households and communities are able to successfully cope with the negative impacts caused by meteorological, hydrological or soil moisture droughts. accounting for temperature's influence in drought dynamics in a context of rapidly accelerating global warming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_pGnbfDY">Our primary drought indicator is the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)</head><p xml:id="_gxCC4x3">developed by Vicente-Serrano, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Beguería, and López-Moreno (2010)</ref>. The SPEI quantifies changes in climatic water balance over a given period considering the temporal difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration influenced by temperature. The SPEI has been widely used by economists to study socio-economic impacts of droughts in various settings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Maystadt, Calderone, and You 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Harari and La Ferrara 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Couttenier and Soubeyran 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Webb 2023</ref>) and has been shown to be a more accurate predictor of crop yield than other drought indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Vicente-Serrano et al. 2012)</ref>. We computed the SPEI for our study clusters using a user-written R-routine <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Beguería and Vicente-Serrano 2017)</ref>. As inputs we used monthly precipitation accumulation (PR) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) from TerraClimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abatzoglou et al. 2018)</ref>, a database with a timespan from 1990 to the present and a 4-km spatial resolution. In addition, we will also demonstrate that our primary findings are robust to alternate definitions of drought.</p><p xml:id="_CwRqKEV">The SPEI is a standardized variable with a zero mean and standard deviation of one, quantifying the water balance in terms of standard deviations from the long-run average (here 1990-2020) in the locality, and thus a negative SPEI value indicates a deficit in water availability relative to the long-term average. We use this as our key definition: a locality experiences a drought if the SPEI value is negative, with more negative values indicating a more severe and prolonged drought event.</p><p xml:id="_WfpEDKu">While this definition agrees with a qualitative definition of a drought event: 'a deficit of water compared with normal conditions' (Van Loon 2015), it is important to note that there is no agreed universal definition of drought that is quantifiable (Lloyd-Hughes 2014). In standardized drought indicators such as the SPEI, drought intensity can categorized into mild (negative values up to -1), moderate (-1 to -1.5), severe (-1.5 to -2) and extreme (less than -2) (McKee, Doesken, and Kleist 1993).</p><p xml:id="_Y3PzWQC">We focus on the meher season that is the main cropping season in most of Ethiopia spanning between June and September. 17 We therefore compute the 4-month lag SPEI (SPEI-4) for each cluster at the end of each September, calculating the location specific changes in the climatic water balance from the long-run average during the whole meher season.</p><p xml:id="_8fWfrv9">Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the distribution of SPEI during the meher seasons in the past 16 years, between 2005 and 2020. The 2016 meher season was characterized by an extreme drought in the study localities with the median SPEI value close to -2 standard deviations. In other years, the average (median) SPEI value fluctuates between -1 and +1 standard deviations, and this is also the case for the 2017-2020 period during which the study took place. Focusing on this period, we see that the 2017 and 2018 meher seasons were characterized by more relative dryness than the 2019 and 2020 seasons. As noted above, we primarily consider drought conditions in 2019 and 2020 meher seasons that are the relevant seasons for the midline (in 2019) and endline (in 2021) survey rounds, respectively. During the 2019 meher season, about one-third of the study clusters experienced drought-like conditions (i.e., negative SPEI), while in the 2020 meher only 5 percent of the clusters recorded a negative SPEI value.</p><p xml:id="_2qSq8yr">[Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> here] To focus on drought events, we create a drought shock variable by setting positive SPEI values to zero, a procedure that is appropriately described as generating a positive rectified SPEI variable.</p><p xml:id="_mGAasTH">Then, to facilitate interpretation of the regression coefficients, we multiply this positive rectified SPEI variable with -1 so that larger positive values indicate worsening drought conditions. Conditional on being positive (i.e., non-zero), the mean as well as median value of this drought shock variable is 0.23 units of standard deviation (SD) and maximum 0.47 SD in the 2019 and 2020 meher seasons (where the standard deviation refers to the normalized deviation relative to the long-term mean). Therefore, we will interpret the impact of drought shocks at 0.25 SD, a benchmark level that falls at the center of the spectrum of variation we see in our drought indicator during the study period. Importantly, this is a shock that is considerably milder than what is 17 Meher is by far the most important agricultural season in Ethiopia with more than 90 percent of the total cereal production in the country taking place during this season <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Taffesse, Dorosh, and Gemessa 2012)</ref>. In our sample of households, the belg harvest contributed only about 5 % to the total annual crop production (in terms of total value measured at the baseline).</p><p xml:id="_XrWnWm8">commonly understood to be a severe drought (i.e., the 2016 drought in Ethiopia, as noted above, has a median SPEI score close to -2, or roughly eight times more severe than the typical shock observed in our study period). However, we will demonstrate that even these mild drought conditions (i.e., SPEI between 0 and -1) exert sizable adverse impacts on household and individual wellbeing among the poor PSNP households in our sample.</p><p xml:id="_gFFSUSq">Our econometric analyses measure the impact of drought shocks on outcomes of interest measured at the midline and endline. The endline took place in the post-harvest period in February-April 2021. For the endline observations, we therefore define the drought indicator based on the previous meher season that occurred between June and September 2020. The midline took place during the 2019 meher (between July and October). It is therefore not a priori clear whether the 2019 or 2018 drought conditions are most relevant for the midline observations. To address this, we seek guidance from our data by restricting the sample to control clusters and then regressing the outcome variables separately on two types of drought indicators. The first indicator defines drought using the 2019 meher (i.e., contemporaneous) conditions for the midline and the second indicator defines drought using the 2018 meher (i.e., previous year's meher) conditions for the midline. The regression results reported in Table <ref type="table">C1</ref> in Appendix C indicate that the majority of the outcomes respond to the drought conditions during the ongoing meher season in the midline.</p><p xml:id="_YC8zQW9">The only clear exception is women's BMI for which the previous meher season in the midline seems a stronger predictor. Therefore, when we measure the impacts on women's body masses, we define the drought variable using the 2018 meher conditions if the measurements were taken in the midline survey. For all other indicators measured at the midline, we consider the 2019 meher that overlapped with the midline survey round. However, we will also subsequently demonstrate that our primary findings are robust to alternate strategies to identify the appropriate drought shock at midline.</p></div>

The table also shows that the households are equally exposed to drought shocks across the four study arms: the SPEI values for each meher season during the study period are balanced across the study arms. This is expected given that the randomization was stratified at the woreda level and weather outcomes for a single season are highly spatially correlated within a woreda (as we show later).</p><p xml:id="_QGtRTJW">Another potential source of bias in this analysis would be a high level of serial correlation in drought exposure, such that areas identified as experiencing droughts during the study period were already characterized by higher levels of poverty driven by past exposure to droughts. We can assess this hypothesis by regressing the drought shock indicator for midline and endline on various household welfare indicators measured at the baseline. None of the coefficients are statistically significant at the 5%-level and all are close to zero, indicating that there is no correlation between baseline poverty levels and drought exposure during the study period (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">D2</ref> in Appendix D).</p></div>

Considering the baseline mean of 2.1 months in the control group, this translates into a 36 percent increase in the household food gap. The corresponding drought impact in treated clusters is less than half of this: 0.32 months or 15 percent, and this effect (𝛽+ 𝛿) is only weakly statistically significant (p=0.06).

The corresponding impact in SPIR clusters is negative and statistically significant, indicating that treated households are also negatively affected by drought shocks. However, the average drought impact is one third this magnitude in treated households, where a 0.25 SD increase in relative dryness decreases livestock holdings only by nine percent (0.09 TLU units), on average.

However, this estimate is not statistically different from zero at conventional levels (p-value = 0.164). The estimated effect of droughts for treated households is positive but not statistically different from zero (p = 0.232); however, the hypothesis that the effects of drought are equivalent for treatment and control households can be rejected at the one percent level (column 3 in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). A very similar pattern is observed for BMI, where in control households, the effect of a 0.25 SD increase in relative dryness is less than -1 percent (-0.04 m 2 /kg) and marginally significant (p=0.089). The corresponding estimate in treated households is positive and insignificant, but again statistically different vis-à-vis the effect estimated for control households (column 4 in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).

In line with the previous literature (Abiona and Koppensteiner 2018; Epstein et al. 2020; Díaz and Saldarriaga 2023), droughts increase the risk of IPV in control clusters. Here, a 0.25 SD increase in SPEI increases the risk of women experiencing intimate partner violence by 21 percent (or 1.4 percentage points). The corresponding impacts in treated households are considerably smaller in magnitude, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that droughts have no impact on IPV in treated clusters. The difference in the estimated drought impacts between control and treated households are statistically significant at the one percent level, suggestive of a meaningful programming effect of SPIR vis-a-vis drought against IPV. In Table G1 we look at the impacts of droughts and SPIR programming on different forms of IPV and find that sexual violence is particularly sensitive to drought shocks in control households. The drought impacts on physical and emotional violence are positive, but somewhat smaller and less precisely estimated.

Moreover, because the meher season prior to the endline had limited drought exposure (only about 5 percent of the clusters recorded a negative SPEI value during 2020 meher), we assess the impact of the 2019 drought conditions during which, about one-third of the study clusters recorded negative SPEI.

First, previous work examining the impacts of droughts in Ethiopia and elsewhere in Africa have often quantified droughts in terms of deviation from long-term precipitation during the cropping season <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Hirvonen, Sohnesen, and Bundervoet 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Thiede 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Shively 2017)</ref>. We obtained monthly precipitation data from the TerraClimate database <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abatzoglou et al. 2018)</ref> and computed Z-score deviations of precipitation (rainfall) during the meher season. As with the SPEI indicator, we created a rainfall shock variable by rectifying positive Z-score values to zero and multiplied this positive rectified rainfall variable with -1 so that larger positive values indicate worsening conditions. Table <ref type="table">F1</ref> in Appendix F shows that this alternative drought indicator yields qualitatively similar results: rainfall shocks are highly damaging in control clusters and less so in treated clusters.</p><p xml:id="_wYQyyv3">Second, a potential concern in including the woreda fixed effects to the estimated equation is that they may absorb a large amount of variation in the drought indicator <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Fisher et al. 2012)</ref>. To check this, we regressed the drought indicator on the woreda dummies and the survey round dummy.</p><p xml:id="_ufru2at">This regression yields an R 2 of 0.36, indicating that there remains considerable variation in the drought indicator after controlling for woreda and survey round fixed effects.

Yet, the overall narratives reported in this paragraph and in Leight et al. are similar: the SPIR treatment effects on livestock assets and food security are modest when the full sample of households is considered. Leight et al find positive effects on livestock holdings when the sample is restricted to the poorest households that received the livelihood transfer, but not for the less poor households.</p><p xml:id="_9fzmtSE">further show that our results are robust to replacing woreda fixed effects with a binary indicator capturing the region in which the study cluster is located.</p><p xml:id="_5wE8ENQ">Third, the survey round dummy aims to control for shocks that are common to all households surveyed at the same time (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic). However, in Ethiopian context, covariate shocks can be highly region-specific raising a concern that our drought shock variable could be capturing the impact of some other covariate shocks instead. To address this, we replace the survey round dummy with region-specific time fixed effects. As before, the results are robust to this adjustment (Table <ref type="table">F3</ref> in Appendix F).</p><p xml:id="_k5e9D3g">Fourth, the midline survey took place during the 2019 meher season. In the analyses we considered the drought conditions during this season for the outcomes measured in the midline survey, except for BMI that we hypothesized to have longer response time to droughts. Table <ref type="table">F4</ref> in Appendix F</p><p xml:id="_wW7RC7b">shows the results when we switch to using the 2018 meher season conditions for food security, livestock holdings, women's diet diversity and IPV outcomes. For BMI, we now used the 2019 meher drought indicator value. For all outcomes, the magnitudes of the coefficients and/or their precision decrease but, the coefficients on the drought indicator are always of opposite sign to the coefficient on the interaction term, corresponding to the finding that SPIR offered protection during droughts.</p><p xml:id="_R7TQrQJ">Fifth, the 2020-2021 period is characterized with considerable volatility in Ethiopia. Apart from the COVID-19 pandemic, part of the study area was attacked by desert locusts that decimated harvests <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Alderman et al. 2020)</ref>. Meanwhile, a 2-year civil war broke in November 2020 wreaking havoc in the SPIR study areas located in the Amhara region <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Alderman et al. 2021)</ref>. If drought shocks are correlated with these other covariate shocks, then our drought impact estimates may be biased. To explore this, we merged the household survey data with remote sensed data on locust invasions (FAO 2023) and conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Raleigh et al. 2010)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">F5</ref> in Appendix F then replicates the main regressions by controlling for locust and conflict shocks. The estimates are near identical to those reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> indicating that the story documented here is not driven by other major shocks that occurred in these localities during the study period.</p><p xml:id="_Asue8xJ">Sixth, the 2016 drought was particularly severe in our study clusters, raising a question of whether our results are driven by households' exposure to the 2016 drought through serially correlated shocks. In Appendix G, we show that the drought shocks that occurred during the study period in 2019-2021 are only weakly correlated with the variation in household's exposure to the 2016 drought. Moreover, our results are robust to controlling for drought conditions in the 2016 meher season (Table <ref type="table">G1</ref> in Appendix G).</p><p xml:id="_3j2jKbb">Finally, previous research has found that drought shocks shape migration patterns in rural Ethiopia <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Gray and Mueller 2012)</ref>.

As Table <ref type="table">F6</ref> shows, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that drought shocks do not change household composition in control clusters when measured in terms of number of members (column 1) or in terms of adult equivalents (column 3). Moreover, the coefficient on the SPIR interaction term is not statistically different from zero (columns 2 and 4) indicating no differential drought impacts between treatment and control clusters.</p></div>

The impacts of global warming are already visible; in East Africa, droughts now occur on average once every three years instead of every six years as in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Haile et al. 2019</ref>). Therefore, one of the most urgent global development questions is how to improve resilience of poor rural households as the negative effects of global warming intensify.</p><p xml:id="_9Tf3Yd9">Our research began to address this question by studying the effectiveness of light-touch graduation model programming in protecting households against local droughts. Droughts result in large increases in food insecurity and sizable fluctuations in household livestock holdings in control households only benefitting from the Ethiopia's flagship safety net program, the PSNP. The average drought impacts on women's diet diversity and body masses are relatively smaller in magnitude and less precisely estimated. However, the risk of intimate partner violence increases dramatically during droughts in the control clusters. Assessing the impacts of identical droughts in localities that were exposed to the SPIR program, we find that these relatively light-touch 26 More specifically, we accounted savings in banks, village economic and savings associations (VESAs), rural savings and credit cooperatives (RUSACCOs), microfinance institutions and cash kept at home or with a relative. These questions were not asked in the baseline survey instrument and therefore, equation is estimated without 𝑌 𝑖,𝑘,𝑑,𝑡=0 . The total savings values are adjusted to Ethiopian birr for the year 2018 (the baseline survey began in January 2018) and then converted to US dollars by applying a purchasing power (PPP) adjusted exchange rate from 2017, the most recent year for which the International Comparison Program has released PPP exchange rates. livelihood interventions were highly effective in mitigating the negative effects of droughts on household food security and productive assets (livestock), indicating that the program substantially improved resilience among poor households. Previous work in this area finds that women often bear the brunt of weather and other shocks within households <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Dercon and Krishnan 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Díaz and Saldarriaga 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Epstein et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abiona and Koppensteiner 2018)</ref>. To this end, we find that the SPIR interventions protected women's diet diversity and physical health (as measured by body mass) against droughts. Moreover, the impact on IPV was entirely muted in clusters that benefitted from the SPIR livelihood interventions.</p><p xml:id="_NZgRH7Q">As documented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Leight et al. (2023)</ref>, the SPIR program led to substantial increases in accumulation of livestock assets as well as increased income from livestock products. Households exposed to the program were also considerably more likely to save and access formal credit than the control households only receiving the PSNP. These increases in productive assets and improvements in financial inclusion likely form the mechanism that offered protection during droughts. Our further analysis suggests that varying the intensity of the livelihood or nutrition interventions did not bring about additional protective impacts. Moreover, the livelihood grants were not a necessary component: comparable poor households that did not receive the grant but benefitted from basic livelihood programming were similarly protected against droughts as were the other treated households.</p><p xml:id="_PDUGXXM">Due to the experiment and the exogenous nature of drought shocks we consider the internal validity of these findings strong. However, we should be cautious when generalizing these results outside of the study population <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Banerjee, Chassang, and Snowberg 2017)</ref> or outside the study period within the same population <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Rosenzweig and Udry 2020)</ref>. The study population is formed of beneficiaries of a large-scale and long running safety net program that provides regular albeit small cash or food payments against labor intensive public works. We do not observe the counter-factual of what would have happened if the control group did not benefit from the PSNP and therefore cannot unpack the role of these regular transfers. Previous research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Knippenberg and Hoddinott (2017)</ref> based on quasi-experimental methods finds that PSNP households remain highly vulnerable to droughts, but recover quicker from these shocks than other poor households not benefitting from the program. Moreover, the study period was characterized by typical weather fluctuations during the main cropping season (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) but did not contain a major 'once-in-a-decade' type drought. We find that these typical year-to-year variations in drought stress are highly damaging for households and women in control areas, but not in areas exposed to the SPIR program. Yet, we cannot be sure whether the program would have offered similar protection against a major 2015/16 style drought that occurred across large part of Ethiopia (NDRMC 2016; Hirvonen, Sohnesen, and Bundervoet 2020). Another limitation of our study pertains to the channel through which droughts increase the IPV risk and the mechanism through which the SPIR program mitigates these effects. Previous work in this area has theorized that income shocks alter IPV risk through changes to intra-household bargaining or poverty-related stress levels in the household <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aizer 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Fox et al. 2002)</ref>. Since many of the SPIR program components explicitly targeted women while also leading to improvements in household incomes, it may have concurrently changed intrahousehold bargaining and reduced poverty-related stress. Unfortunately, the study design does not allow us to unpack this further.</p><p xml:id="_YKAzXRJ">The most successful graduation model programs pioneered by BRAC (an international nongovernmental organization) have shown large increases in household consumption, food security and asset levels, both in the short and long-term <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Banerjee et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Balboni et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bandiera et al. 2017)</ref>. The BRAC model involves large asset transfers (in the region of 500 to 2000 USD-PPP) and requires intensive implementation raising questions about its scalability into existing large scale safety net programs. The SPIR intervention was designed as a light-touch graduation model program, embedded into the PSNP, one of the largest safety net programs in Africa. The main evaluation of the program documented positive impacts on productive assets, incomes, and financial inclusion but it did not result in similar transformation in households' economic trajectories as the BRAC model evaluated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Banerjee et al.

Appendix D. Balance checks Table D1. Balance in baseline outcomes and drought conditions across study arms Appendix E. Exploring spatial correlation across study clusters</p><p xml:id="_gpjjZvA">To explore spatial dependencies in our data, we first calculated the Euclidean distances between all cluster pairs. The mean distance is 256 km, and the median is 308 km. However, these averages hide the fact that the density distribution of the distances is bimodal (Figure <ref type="figure">E1</ref>). Given that our study clusters are in two regions, the cluster pairs are located either between 0 and 200 km or between 300 and 600 km from each other.</p><p xml:id="_K3w2pbr">We expect that the weather outcomes in each agricultural season are highly correlated between clusters that are located close to each other. 27 To verify this, we computed the SPEI for each meher season between 1990 and 2021 for all clusters and used these data to calculate the correlation coefficient of the meher season SPEI between all cluster-pairs. We then used these dyadic data to explore the relationship between these correlation coefficients and distances between clusters.</p><p xml:id="_j25pvtn">Figure <ref type="figure">E2</ref> shows the results based on a local polynomial regression that regresses the correlation coefficient on the distance variable. As expected, the correlation coefficient is close to 1 for clusters located very close to each other. As we move to clusters that are farther apart, the correlation decreases. For clusters located 600 km apart from each other, the correlation coefficient is 0.2, on average, suggesting a relatively weak spatial correlation in meher season weather outcomes.</p></div>

Exposure to the 2016 drought</head><p xml:id="_JxsUS9F">The droughts that occurred in 2015 and 2016 in Ethiopia were one of the most severe meteorological droughts the country had witnessed in many decades. In our study clusters, the drought in 2016 was particularly severe, raising a question of whether the findings documented here could be attributed to the households' exposure to the 2016 drought. We begin by acknowledging that nearly all the study clusters were similarly exposed to this drought (as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), with the minimum and maximum SPEI value in our sample ranging between -1.7 and -1.9. Moreover, the local polynomial regressions reported in Figures G1 to G3 below indicate that SPEI value in 2016 meher season is not correlated with SPEI values during the study period. This is also evident when we look at the raw correlation coefficients: the correlation coefficient between 2016 meher SPEI and 2018 meher SPEI is 0.068; between 2016 and 2019 is 0.135, and between 2016 and 2020 is 0.048. Therefore, it is unlikely that the exposure to the 2016 drought is driving our results. This is further confirmed in Table <ref type="table">G1</ref> where we replicate Table <ref type="table">1</ref> by controlling for the 2016 drought conditions in the study cluster: the estimated 𝛽, 𝜗 and 𝛿 coefficients are very similar to those reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

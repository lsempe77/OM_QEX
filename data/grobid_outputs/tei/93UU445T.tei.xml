<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_dq56keg">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview and study design</head><p xml:id="_jb9Phqx">The objective of this report is to present results from the midline survey conducted as part of the IMPEL evaluation of SPIR-II, a randomized controlled trial launched in 2022. The second phase of the Strengthen PSNP Institutions and Resilience (SPIR-II) project aims to enhance livelihoods, increase resilience to shocks, and improve food security and nutrition for rural households vulnerable to food insecurity in Ethiopia. The project is situated within Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), one of the largest safety net programs in Africa. Funded by USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), SPIR-II is implemented by World Vision International (lead), CARE, and ORDA in the Amhara and Oromia regions of Ethiopia.</p><p xml:id="_ZsVJTw3">The IMPEL SPIR-II impact evaluation employs an experimental design with three arms comparing two treatment combinations of livelihood and nutrition graduation model programming provided to PSNP beneficiaries relative to a control group receiving only PSNP transfers. The treatment assignment is randomized at the kebele level in 234 kebeles. In the first arm (T1; the control group), PSNP is implemented by the government with SPIR II support for the provision of cash and food transfers only (no supplemental programming). In the second arm (T2), SPIR-II programming is rolled out to PSNP beneficiary households in conjunction with nurturing care groups targeting enhanced infant and young child nutritional practices. In the third arm (T3), PSNP beneficiary households receive SPIR-II programming and nurturing care groups (NCGs), supplemented with additional targeted cash transfers to pregnant and lactating women.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_8e38w5C">Data, Outcomes, and Sample</head><p xml:id="_eWkDM4Z">The evaluation includes three primary rounds of data collection: the baseline survey, conducted in August-September 2022, that entailed interviews with both the primary female respondent (pregnant or lactating woman) and her spouse. The midline survey was conducted between August 2023 and January 2024 with households in the Amhara region interviewed later due to the ongoing conflict in the region. The endline survey is scheduled for August-October 2025, roughly 24 months after the midline and 36 months after the baseline.</p><p xml:id="_6gtakTR">The primary outcomes for the evaluation were defined in a pre-analysis plan prior to the baseline survey. For livelihood outcomes, the primary outcomes are daily household per-capita consumption expenditure, the total value of productive assets, the total value of livestock assets, and savings (both binary and continuous variables). For nutrition-related outcomes, the primary outcomes are height-forage (measured among children 30-48 months at endline), the prevalence of children 6-23 months consuming a diet of minimum diversity (MDD-C) at midline, and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) knowledge.</p><p xml:id="_kPAVppP">The baseline survey included a sample of 3,015 households in 234 kebeles from 15 woredas in Amhara and Oromia regions; the inclusion criteria required that households were PSNP beneficiaries reporting the presence of an infant under nine months of age (along with his / her mother or primary caretaker), v or a pregnant woman. Statistical tests indicate that the randomization achieved balance: the baseline data showed no evidence of any significant differences in observable characteristics across the three study arms.</p><p xml:id="_jtZAAz9">The midline survey aimed to recontact all 3,015 households interviewed at the baseline. The survey commenced in Oromia in mid-August, concluding in late October. The midline survey was launched later in Amhara due to widespread conflict in the region. In Amhara, the survey teams were able to launch the survey at the beginning of October, completing interviews in 68 out of 80 selected kebeles by mid-November. The remaining 12 kebeles were surveyed in December 2023.</p><p xml:id="_zR4kZuN">Out of the 3,015 households interviewed at baseline, 2,954 were successfully interviewed at midline, resulting in an attrition rate of a mere two percent. We see no meaningful differences in recontact rates across the three study arms.</p><p xml:id="_CS6QCvY">The sample size used in the nutrition analyses is smaller, primarily due to a higher-than-expected number of unsuccessful pregnancies in Oromia. Among households initially enrolled with an infant at baseline and successfully contacted at midline, nearly 98 percent reported the child was still present. However, in Oromia, only 59 percent of pregnant woman-enrolled households had an infant or young child at midline, compared to 83 percent in Amhara. Additionally, we excluded 167 households due to child age (either younger than 6 months or older than 23 months), resulting in a sample of 2,233 children that we use in the nutrition analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_7ZEvHYR">Exposure to SPIR interventions</head><p xml:id="_nABtDrN">Analysis of households' exposure to SPIR interventions reveals a high degree of implementation fidelity. At midline, households residing in SPIR intervention kebeles were more than four times more likely to belong to a village economic and savings association (VESA) than households in non-intervention kebeles. As intended, roughly one-third of the households in the treatment kebeles report receiving the livelihood grant, and they predominantly allocated this grant to livestock-related activities such as fattening or purchasing more animals. Meanwhile, only four percent of the control households (T1 arm) report receipt of a livelihood grant.</p><p xml:id="_VgRdTM2">As for the core nutrition interventions, participation in nurturing care groups was high in both treatment arms, ranging between 75 and 89 percent of the households in T2 and T3 arms, respectively. Twentytwo percent of the households in the control arms also reported to have taken part in NG session. However, there seemed to be confusion among some control households in this regard, with many reporting that these group sessions were led by a health extension worker, and not a peer lead mother. Over 92 percent of the households in T3 reported receiving maternal cash transfers, aligning with the program design, while the proportions in the other study arms were less than 2 percent. Caregivers who received maternal cash transfers primarily reported that the funds were directed to child feedingrelated expenses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_5tnfKxa">Exposure to recent shocks</head><p xml:id="_CPKC4NA">The midline survey asked about households' experiences with shocks over the past year (since the baseline survey). In Amhara, the most frequently reported shock type was increasing food prices, reported by 92 percent of households, followed by rising input prices at 65 percent. Around half of the households in Amhara faced challenges related to crop diseases and delays in receiving food or cash assistance. Thirty-nine percent of the households reported insufficient rainfall, while 40 percent experienced unpredictable rainfall. Fifteen percent reported instances of violence. In Oromia, similarly, increasing food prices affected most households, reported by 91 percent. Insufficient or unpredictable rainfall was reported by 75 percent and 65 percent of the households, respectively, while 21 percent encountered locust-related issues, and only 2 percent reported incidents of violence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_bwqvxmt">Nutrition outcomes</head><p xml:id="_Dhz2XwE">The project's theory of change posits that combining intensive behavior change communication to enhance caregiver knowledge with the provision of maternal cash transfers, specifically aimed at alleviating economic constraints to child feeding, will lead to improved diets and feeding practices among infants and young children, preventing linear growth faltering. The midline evaluation primarily focuses on assessing the initial impacts at the initial stages of this theory, particularly on caregiver knowledge and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. The endline, to be administered in 2025 when the children are 30-47 months, will be more appropriate for assessing the impact on indicators of linear growth faltering: height for age Z-score and child stunting prevalence.</p><p xml:id="_F2pA6K4">At midline, caregivers in SPIR treatment areas showed better nutrition knowledge compared to those in control areas. However, while statistically significant, these differences were not substantial in terms of magnitude, possibly due to the simplicity of the knowledge quiz.</p><p xml:id="_XFhtzqJ">Evaluating IYCF practices for children aged 6-23 months revealed that children in the T3 arm, receiving maternal cash transfers, had better outcomes compared to T1 and T2. Around 30 percent of children in T3 achieved a diet characterized by minimum diversity, significantly higher than T1 (13%) and T2 (14%). Children in T3 were more likely to consume eggs, dairy, legumes and nuts as well as Vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables compared to other study arms; they were also more likely to achieve the criteria for minimum meal frequency (MMF). Additionally, 22 percent of the children in T3 arm met the threshold for a minimum acceptable diet (MAD) while only 9 percent of children in T1 and 11 percent in T2 did so. These differences in IYCF practices between T3 and the other study arms are all statistically significant and attributable to the maternal cash transfers combined with other SPIR programming.</p><p xml:id="_pbRBHM9">As expected, these significant improvements in IYCF feeding practices in T3 arm have not yet translated into substantially better anthropometric outcomes. At midline, 37 percent of T1 children and 38 percent of T2 children were classified as stunted, while in T3, this was slightly lower at 35 percent; this difference is narrowly statistically significant at the ten percent level. Wasting prevalence ranged between 6-8 percent, with no statistically distinct differences between the study arms.</p><p xml:id="_kBpXwVp">We also measured early childhood development using the CREDI instrument. Consistent with the findings around IYCF practices and anthropometrics, we observe evidence of a large and precisely estimated increase in measured early childhood development scores in T3 only, where CREDI scores are around 0.2 standard deviations higher compared to the control arm (T1). No comparable effect is observed in T2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Q7QERj5">Livelihood outcomes</head><p xml:id="_v62fWZ6">Anticipating limited impacts on livelihood outcomes in the initial year of implementation, the midline survey focused on a small subset of livelihood indicators. According to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, severe food insecurity decreased from 58 percent at baseline to 43 percent at midline, while moderately food-insecure households increased from 32 percent to 46 percent at midline. The trends in control and SPIR households were similar without statistically significant differences. By midline, nearly 90 percent of households reported an acceptable Food Consumption Score (FCS), up from 75 percent at baseline. Treatment estimates indicate a slightly more improved FCS among SPIR households compared to the control group.</p><p xml:id="_jEtfFn9">Extreme poverty remains high. In control (T1) households, the mean per capita consumption fell from $1.78 to $1.48 between baseline and midline while in SPIR (T2 and T3) households it fell from $1.80 to $1.58. The percentage of individuals below the $1.90 poverty line increased from 70 percent to 82 percent in T1 households and from 70 percent to 78 percent among households in the pooled treatment arms (T2 and T3). A regional breakdown of the poverty numbers reveals that poverty headcount for the full sample increased more in Oromia (from 68.2% to 79.0%) than in Amhara (from 77.5% to 79.2%). The differences in consumption and poverty trends are small between control and SPIR households, indicating that the SPIR livelihood programming did not meaningfully impact these outcomes between baseline and midline. Furthermore, additional analysis that separates the T2 and T3 arms indicates that the positive effects on livelihood outcomes are predominantly attributed to households in the T3 arm, which received the maternal cash transfers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_aCfeMHV">Summing up</head><p xml:id="_qQsstkG">The SPIR project displays a strong adherence to its planned implementation. However, the extremely high poverty prevalence combined with a highly volatile context characterized by multiple types of shocks poses ongoing challenges. Nevertheless, this midline analysis highlights significant improvements in IYCF practices among households in areas where maternal cash transfers, in combination with other SPIR interventions, are provided. Considering the theory of change, this emphasizes the necessity of addressing both caregiver knowledge and resource constraints to enhance child diets and feeding practices in this setting. Overall, these findings present promising prospects for detecting positive effects on children's anthropometric outcomes at the endline.</p></div>

Since the turn of the millennium, the number of social safety net programs has doubled <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hickey et al. 2018</ref>) and today, each country in the region operates at least one major safety net program <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Beegle, Coudouel, and Monsalve 2018)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_ECFgefJ">There is now strong evidence from a wide variety of contexts showing that these programs can be effectively used to improve food security and increase asset accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Andrews, Hsiao, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ralston 2018, Hidrobo et al. 2018)</ref>. Building on this evidence, there is a growing interest in using social safety net programs as a platform to achieve broader objectives over and above food security, including the reduction of poverty and the enhancement of resilience. One such objective relates to graduation: moving households away from long-term support and enabling them to build resilient and self-reliant livelihoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sabates-Wheeler et al. 2021)</ref>. A second objective centers around rendering existing programs nutrition-sensitive by integrating transfers with nutrition and water, sanitation, and health (WASH) training and other interventions to better address the underlying causes of maternal and child malnutrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ruel and Alderman 2013)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_JFyHj3U">Against this backdrop, the second phase of the Strengthen PSNP Institutions and Resilience (SPIR-II) project aims to enhance livelihoods, increase resilience to shocks, and improve food security and nutrition for rural households vulnerable to food insecurity in Ethiopia. The project is situated within Ethiopia's PSNP program, one of the largest safety net programs in Africa. Funded by USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), SPIR-II is implemented by World Vision International (lead), CARE, and ORDA in the Amhara and Oromia regions of Ethiopia.</p><p xml:id="_xQQZzAr">The IMPEL SPIR-II impact evaluation employs an experimental design with multiple treatment arms comparing combinations of livelihood and nutrition graduation model programming provided to PSNP beneficiaries relative to a control group receiving only PSNP transfers. The design includes 234 kebeles assigned to three treatment arms. In the first arm (the control group), PSNP is implemented by the government with SPIR-II support for the provision of cash and food transfers only (no supplemental programming). In the second arm, SPIR-II programming is rolled out to PSNP beneficiary households in conjunction with nurturing care groups (NCG) targeting enhanced infant and young child nutritional practices. In the third arm, PSNP beneficiary households receive SPIR-II programming and NCGs, supplemented with additional targeted cash transfers to pregnant and lactating women.</p><p xml:id="_7fNncRf">This impact evaluation will contribute to current evidence on the effectiveness of graduation model programs, particularly by adding new evidence on graduation models including substantial nutrition programming, and on whether the effectiveness of such a model is enhanced by a supplemental maternal cash transfer. There is considerable evidence from an evaluation of a six-country study of programs designed like BRAC's Targeting the Ultra-Poor (TUP) program and related studies that graduation models improve household economic outcomes, including consumption, food security, assets, financial inclusion, labor supply, and income as well as some measures of mental health related to stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Banerjee et al. 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Banerjee et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Banerjee et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Bandiera et al. 2017)</ref>. However, an important evidence gap persists around the question of whether graduation models can also be designed to address maternal and child malnutrition and thereby potentially expand the longterm benefits of the program through investments in human capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Leight et al. 2023)</ref>. The impact evaluation of the first phase of the SPIR project (2016-2021), which included integrated livelihood and nutrition programming, found impacts on women's nutrition knowledge and mother's diets, but limited impacts on child diets and virtually no impacts on child anthropometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alderman et al. 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Alderman et al. 2022)</ref>. The findings suggested that an important factor limiting program impact on child nutrition was the strategy employed for nutrition behavior change communication, relying on community health facilitators who were unable to achieve sufficiently intensive interaction with SPIR households.</p><p xml:id="_6xnAfs3">The innovations in nutrition-related programming that are a focus of this evaluation center around enhancing infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices, particularly suboptimal complementary feeding practices that have been widely speculated to be inhibiting child growth and development in Ethiopia <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Golan et al. 2019</ref>). The NCG model, pioneered by World Vision in a wide range of other contexts, is based on groups of 10-15 community-based trained volunteer agents who cascade down social behavior change communication (SBCC) messages and activities to caregiver groups at the community level.

In addition, improving caregiver knowledge may not be sufficient to improve complementary feeding practices if households cannot afford to purchase nutritious foods.

This sample comprised kebeles that were not included in the previous impact evaluations conducted by IFPRI and World Vision under SPIR: this includes kebeles that were served by SPIR but were not included in the SPIR impact evaluation (generally because programming had already been initiated); and new kebeles. In addition, a small number of eligible kebeles (three) were excluded from the study due to security concerns at the time of the baseline survey in 2022.

Therefore, the third study arm (T3) introduces maternal cash transfers of $20 per month during the child's first 24 months of life to relax possible financial constraints to child feeding. These cash transfers are benchmarked relative to household-level consumption as observed in the SPIR-I endline survey conducted among a sample of PSNP beneficiary households in early 2021; consumption was around $100 per month per household, and thus the transfer represents around a 20% increase in consumption. This is consistent with evidence in the 2 At the kebele level, only around 10% of households outside of the IMPEL sample are eligible for livelihood grant. This eligibility process was determined separate from the IMPEL study and is not described here. 3 Standard government-led nutrition programming in Ethiopia is delivered primarily by health extension workers and the health development army through relatively infrequent interactions to provide nutritional information and counseling to pregnant women and mothers of young children.

PSNP + SPIR-II + NCG + maternal cash transfers (79 kebeles)</p><p xml:id="_tK4wqrC">The study arm T1 serves as a control group of PSNP households against which the impacts of SPIR-II programming will be measured. PSNP households in arm T2 benefit from SPIR-II resilience programming and will be exposed to the NCG intervention. The study arm T3 receives the same intervention package as households in T2 but also benefits from maternal cash transfers. This multi-arm cRCT design permits us to evaluate the causal impact of both livelihood and nutrition graduation programming in SPIR-II. First, comparing outcomes in T1 to T2 and T3 permits us to quantify the causal impact of the SPIR-II livelihood graduation programming on outcomes such as financial inclusion, assets, consumption, resilience, and poverty. Second, by experimentally varying the nutrition interventions, the study will provide valuable information on nutrition-sensitive programming within the PSNP. More specifically, by comparing outcomes across all three treatment arms, we can assess the relative effectiveness of the NCG intervention on IYCF practices and child growth outcomes (e.g., child stunting prevalence) with and without an added maternal cash transfers to reduce cost constraints to improving these outcomes.</p></div>

The baseline survey in August-September 2022 sampled PSNP households with a pregnant woman or a child less than 9 months of age (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.2). Prior to the survey, we randomly allocated kebeles into the three study arms.</p><p xml:id="_W4VrTD7">We planned to administer a midline quantitative survey to the entire baseline sample one year after the baseline survey when the children are between 6-23 months of age, permitting us to assess both contact rates and participation in NCGs (process indicators) and acquired knowledge about and adherence to recommended IYCF practices (outcome indicators) (WHO and UNICEF, 2021). The timing of the midline survey had several advantages, including (i) allowing timely measurement of the impact of SPIR-II on child diets and IYCF practices, (ii) inclusion of process monitoring questions for the full sample around household participation in SPIR-II activities, and access to SPIR-II components, and (iii) measurement of intermediate outcomes related to food security to examine progress against program objectives.

Child growth faltering (measured using child height-for-age Z-scores) in Ethiopia and other lowincome country settings largely occurs during the first 1000 days of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Golan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Victora et al., 2010)</ref>. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.3 based on the data from the 2015/16 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), during the first four to five months of life, the height of the average Ethiopia child is similar to the height of the median child in the WHO-2006 growth reference. 5 Golan et al. (2019)  hypothesized that child growth during this period is supported by the relatively high adherence to exclusive breastfeeding in Ethiopia. Rapid growth faltering begins at around 6 months of age when children should be introduced to complementary foods and continues until about 18 months of age. The endline occurs after this period of rapid growth faltering. By that point, children and caregivers in study arms T2 and T3 will have been exposed to the intensive SPIR-II nutrition programming for much of the critical first 1000-day period. The study hypothesis is that this nutrition programming prevents growth faltering during the first 1000 days and as a result, at the endline the HAZ curve of the average child in the treatment arms lie above the HAZ curve of the average child in the control arm.

The planned modules for d endline, however, may require revision based on resource constraints.</p><p xml:id="_R4rPZ6C">It is important to note that all survey rounds will be targeted at the full set of households sampled at baseline. Attrition will be minimized by multiple follow-ups with target households at midline and endline, and tracking as needed; however, we anticipate very low levels of attrition given our previous experience with panel surveys of PSNP households. (In particular, PSNP households are characterized by generally low levels of mobility given their low levels of income and receipt of PSNP benefits; in the SPIR-I evaluation, we observed attrition of only 7% over a four-year period).</p><p xml:id="_u9qEQnq">We cannot rule out that some households may be excluded from the PSNP during retargeting processes conducted during the sampling period, though our understanding based on discussions from World Vision is that the annual retargeting process would be minimal and would not be expected to shift the status of more than 5 percent of households. Given that our sample households may be particularly vulnerable with the presence of a pregnant and lactating woman and infant, they may be less likely to exit the PSNP. That being said, we will document households' participation in the PSNP and in particular dimensions of SPIR-II program in follow-up surveys.</p><p xml:id="_YgeZxsW">Table 2.2: Questionnaire modules, by survey round Module Respondent Baseline Midline Endline Module A.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4" xml:id="_CJMeW96">Limitations</head><p xml:id="_QS6fs6G">The evaluation has a number of limitations. First, while the randomized controlled trial will generate unbiased estimates of treatment effects within the evaluation sample -a characteristic we generally refer to as internal validity -the study kebeles are not a random subsample of the SPIR-II evaluation area. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">7</ref> Accordingly, the findings may not be externally valid for other parts of the SPIR-II operational area, or other areas served by the PSNP.</p><p xml:id="_Wa8Z9M8">Second, the selection of indicators for this evaluation was primarily motivated by the BHA set of required indicators; the research team has then designated some indicators as primary or secondary based on their salience in the intervention theory of change. Due to resource constraints, not all indicators can be measured at both midline and endline, rendering it more challenging to ascertain the full set of treatment effects.</p><p xml:id="_5gQuVpP">Third, we generally report average effects of the interventions on the full sample of interest. We do not anticipate having sufficient statistical power to analyze effects for targeted subgroups of interest: i.e., previous PSNP beneficiaries, or households that are newly qualified for the PSNP. Fourth, while we place the findings from this trial within the broader literature analyzing graduation model programs, it is important to note that SPIR II has a particularly broad set of objectives compared to many other graduation interventions. Because of these broader objectives, interpreting the findings in relation to the graduation model intervention may not be an exact comparison.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3." xml:id="_vh58kE7">THE MIDLINE SURVEY</head><p xml:id="_67NYngb">At the baseline, the sample was formed of PSNP households with a pregnant woman or a child less than nine months of age. In the evaluation, we follow this cohort of children through the study period, and the survey rounds are carefully timed to capture the adherence to age-appropriate IYCF practices, and the growth-faltering dynamics as described in the pre-analysis plan. The baseline survey included 3,015 households in 234 kebeles. Roughly half of the households were enrolled in the study because of a pregnant woman in the household and another half because they had an infant (child less than 9 months of age) in the household.</p><p xml:id="_325PjEJ">The midline survey attempted to contact and re-interview all 3,015 households interviewed at the baseline. The midline survey was conducted during a period of widespread conflict in the Amhara region. Therefore, the survey began in the study kebeles located in the Oromia region. The survey teams began their work on 14 August 2023 with the final interviews in the region conducted on 23 September.</p><p xml:id="_J2jcvpK">In Amhara, the situation in the areas selected for the study sufficiently improved so that the survey teams were able to begin their work on 5 October 2023. Around mid-November, the team returned to Addis Ababa after having completed interviews in 68 kebeles out of the total of 80 Amhara kebeles. The remaining 12 kebeles were at that point actively insecure, rendering them inaccessible. Security conditions in these communities improved at the end of December and the survey teams were able to visit the remaining kebeles in the Amhara region between the end of December 2023 and mid-January 2024.</p><p xml:id="_6RHUy5V">Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.1 provides a summary of the number of interviews conducted by region and by survey round. The household level attrition rate at midline is extremely low: 98 percent of households that were interviewed at the baseline were also interviewed at midline. About 2 percent of the baseline households were not interviewed at midline, either because they had relocated out of the study area or because they refused to be interviewed. The attrition rates across study arms range between 0.8 percent in T3 to 2.6 percent in T1.</p><p xml:id="_PguWVGc">Table 3.1.

The total attrition rate at the index child level is 20 percent. This high attrition rate is primarily due to the unexpectedly large number of unsuccessful pregnancies in the Oromia region, where the index child level attrition rate is almost 25 percent. By contrast, the index level attrition rates are considerably lower among households that were enrolled with an infant at the baseline (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.2).</p><p xml:id="_6xJFSTK">In Oromia, out of the households that were enrolled as a pregnant woman and successfully interviewed at midline, only 59 percent did in fact report the presence of an infant or a young child in their household at midline (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.3). In Amhara, 83 percent out of the households that were enrolled as a pregnant woman and successfully interviewed at midline had an infant or a young child in their household at midline.</p><p xml:id="_rRneTTD">There are two primary reasons that could explain why households in which a woman self-reported pregnancy at baseline do not have a child present at midline. One is that the pregnancy did not conclude in a live birth (or the child subsequently passed away following the birth but prior to the survey date). The second is that the woman was not in fact pregnant at baseline but reported that she was (either believing that she was, or feigning pregnancy). Both survey and intervention staff members shared that women may be motivated to feign pregnancy in a survey in the hope of subsequently receiving some benefit targeted to pregnant women, even though the survey exercise was not explicitly linked to any programmatic benefit provided by either SPIR or any government agency. Among those women who did not have a child present, the survey directly posed a question as to what had happened to their child and 75 percent reported that they had miscarried, and 21 percent said that their child had passed away after delivery; 4 percent admitted they had not been pregnant at baseline. However, these reports may still be inaccurate if women who had previously misreported their pregnancy status are unwilling to admit to this misreporting.</p><p xml:id="_4qJgJmN">Large-scale evidence on miscarriages is extremely limited in rural Ethiopia, as in many low-and middleincome countries, and major surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys generally do not collect data on miscarriages (only stillbirths). However, available evidence from a demographic surveillance site in Eastern Ethiopia suggests a miscarriage rate of around 23 percent <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Assefa, Berhane, and Worku 2013)</ref> , very close to the rate observed in this sample; however, these data are more than a decade old. We also worked with the survey firm to further cross-check the cases of reported incomplete pregnancies in one woreda (Habro) with the local community health facilitator (CHF, employed by World Vision). In this woreda, 17 women who were pregnant at baseline did not report the presence of an infant at midline; the CHFs reported that based on the information available to them, 12 of these cases corresponded to true miscarriages, and in 5 cases the women were never in fact pregnant. We were not able to conduct this exercise on a large scale due to the limited time availability of the CHFs, but this small case study is consistent with the hypothesis of a high underlying miscarriage rate. (It is also important to note, however, that the CHFs' information may also be imperfect.)</p><p xml:id="_vyz2tnV">Table 3.2.

The household-level attrition rate at midline (2%) falls well within this range. However, the higher index-level attrition rate (20%) raises concerns about whether our nutrition analyses remain adequately powered. To address this, we revised our power calculation, taking into consideration that the average cluster (kebele) in our midline sample includes 9 index children, rather than the 12 initially assumed. Fortunately, this reduced number of children per cluster has a negligible impact on the minimum detectable effect sizes, as detailed in the last two rows of Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.4.

Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.1 shows the share of households who are members a VESA, by survey round and study arm. We see that 63 percent of households in T2 arm report membership in a VESA while the corresponding share is 71 percent in T3 arm. Meanwhile, only 16 percent of households in the T1 arm (where there is no supplemental SPIR programming) report having joined a VESA. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_42">A1</ref> in the Appendix disaggregates these data by region. The share of T1 and T2 households reporting to be part of a VESA is slightly higher in Amhara than in Oromia. More than 70 percent of the households that reported joining a VESA did so in 2023. N = 2,954 households.</p><p xml:id="_bvjQKvj">In both the T2 and T3 arms, households eligible for a $300 livelihood grant were determined by selecting the poorest 30 percent within each kebele. Household poverty status was assessed using an asset-based welfare index measured using the baseline data. In T2 arm, 38 percent of households report receipt of such a grant, and 35 percent in T3 arm (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.2). A small number of households (4%) in the T1 arm report receipt of a livelihood grant. In Amhara, about one-third of the households in T2 and T3 arms report receipt of a livelihood grant and 11 percent of the households in T1 arm (Panel A in Figure <ref type="figure">A2</ref> in the Appendix). In Oromia, less than 0.5 percent of the households in T1 arm report receiving a livelihood grant, and about 40 percent of the T2 and T3 report receiving the grant (Panel B in Figure <ref type="figure">A2</ref> in the Appendix). The mean livelihood grant received was 15,518 birr (median 15,800 birr). N = 2,954 households. In Figure 4.3, we compare these reports based on household asset-based poverty status at baseline. We identify households eligible for the livelihood grant as 'extremely poor' and those ineligible for the transfer as 'less poor'. In Panel A of Figure 4.3, over 90 percent of 'extremely poor' households in both T2 and T3 reported receiving the livelihood grant between the baseline and midline surveys, while only 5 percent of T1 households did the same. However, Panel B of Figure 4.3 reveals some non-compliance, with 14 percent of 'less poor' households in the T2 arm and 11 percent in the T3 arm reporting receipt of the livelihood grant despite being ineligible. The behavioral change communication delivered as a part of the SPIR nutrition programming is delivered through neighbor groups (NGs) facilitated by nurturing care group volunteers. The midline data show that the participation in these groups among caregivers in the two treatment arms is very high (76-89%), again indicating high implementation fidelity (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.4). About 22 percent of the T1 households report taking part in NGs (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.3), with a considerably higher share among T1 households located in Amhara (34%) than in Oromia (15%) as shown by Figure <ref type="figure">A3</ref> in the Appendix. The NGs are primarily facilitated by NG leaders or peer mothers. In the survey instrument we asked the respondents who facilitated these NG sessions. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.5 tabulates the responses by treatment status.</p><p xml:id="_24YD8v9">Panel A shows that about half of the T1 respondents that reported taking part in the NGs said that these sessions were led by a health extension worker (HEW), indicating that many respondents may have confused these groups with the government health extension program operating in their kebele or to some other activity led by HEWs.

Finally, nearly all households in the maternal cash transfer arm (T3) report receiving maternal cash transfers while the opposite is true for households in T1 and T2 arms (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.6), with little differences across regions (Figure <ref type="figure">A5</ref> in the Appendix). The respondents reported receiving their first maternal cash transfers largely between December 2022 and March 2023. The average maternal cash transfers recipient reported receiving seven transfers with the mean amount of the latest transfer being 1,524 birr (median 1,100 birr). N = 2,233 households with an index child 6-23 months of age.</p><p xml:id="_DpUF4XV">The livelihood and maternal cash transfers were deposited into bank accounts with the implementation teams assisting recipient households in establishing these accounts. At midline, respondents were asked whether their household operated a bank account. In the T1 arm, 60 percent of households confirmed having a bank account. For the T2 group, 99 percent of those receiving a livelihood grant had a bank account, while 68 percent of those without the grant had one. Over 98 percent of T3 households reported operating a bank account.</p><p xml:id="_bguUYyT">Finally, we asked households how they used the grants or transfers they received, allowing for multiple responses. Panel A in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.7 summarizes the responses for the livelihood grant and Panel B the responses regarding the maternal cash transfer. Those who received the livelihood grant predominantly directed it towards activities involving livestock: 60 percent of grant-receiving households mentioned buying or fattening goats or sheep, 20 percent invested in cattle, and 15 percent focused on purchasing poultry or making investments to poultry or egg production. Conversely, most households receiving maternal cash transfers indicated that they used the money primarily for feeding their children. </p></div>

At midline, the focus of the evaluation lies in evaluating impacts at the upstream of the theory of change: caregiver knowledge and child diets and feeding practices. The endline, to be administered in 2025 when the sample children are 30-47 months, is appropriate for assessing the impact on linear growth faltering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1" xml:id="_XMYkGxN">Caregivers' nutrition knowledge</head><p xml:id="_A4JejyA">Starting with the first step in the theory of chain, we examine the impact of SPIR programming on caregivers' nutrition knowledge, measured through responses to a nutrition knowledge quiz administered as a part of both baseline and midline surveys. The quiz had 11 questions focusing on recommended breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.1). The nutrition knowledge score was then calculated as the total number of correct responses, ranging from a score with a minimum value of zero and a maximum value of 11. If multiple correct answers existed, a point was awarded if the respondent identified at least one of them.</p><p xml:id="_KDCRfTc">Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.1 summarizes the questions in the nutrition knowledge quiz and shows the share of mothers responding correctly to them. At baseline, the average knowledge score ranged between 8.2 and 8.5 across the three study arms, indicating that the quiz may not have been very challenging for the majority of caregivers. Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.1 additionally shows the proportion of correct responses from women for each question, highlighting that mothers exhibit a somewhat better understanding of the recommended breastfeeding practices compared to complementary feeding practices, although the differences are marginal.</p><p xml:id="_jumX2pE">At midline, nutrition knowledge across all study arms improves further, including in T1 (control) arm, presumably as caregivers acquire relevant information while their infants grow. The improvement was larger in study arms T2 and T3 that were exposed to the BCC provided through the NGs than in the T1 group that received now SPIR programming (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">6</ref>.1). While statistically significant, the differences in average knowledge scores across the study arms are relatively small in terms of magnitude. Row 1b in Table <ref type="table">A3</ref> in the Appendix shows the conditional treatment effect estimates based on a regression that controls for pre-specified household, caregiver, and index child characteristics as well as strata fixed effects. The conditional treatment effect estimates are similar to the unconditional estimates reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">6</ref>.1.</p><p xml:id="_D8ZPFNc">If we adjust the strategy employed to grade questions with multiple correct answers, awarding one point for each right response, this substantially reduces the average respondent score compared to the maximum possible (see Table <ref type="table">A5</ref> in the Appendix). In addition, this adjustment creates somewhat larger gaps between the study groups at the midline (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">A6</ref> in the Appendix). For example, the 0.43 treatment effect for 'T1 vs T3' reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">6</ref>.1 translates into a 5.2 percent increase when we compare it to the baseline mean among the control group. The corresponding treatment effect reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">A6</ref> is 12.3 percent.</p><p xml:id="_Q3VBkQj">Table 6.1.

Since about half of the index children in our sample were not born at baseline, we focus on the data collected at the midline. The survey instrument asks caregivers a series of Yes/No questions about children's consumption of different foods and liquids in the 24 hours before the interview. Following recently revised WHO and UNICEF guidelines (WHO and UNICEF 2021), we grouped foods into eight groups: breastmilk; grains, roots, and tubers; legumes and nuts; dairy products; flesh foods; eggs; vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables; and other fruits and vegetables. Children's dietary quality is measured with a count variable capturing the number of food groups consumed by the child (i.e., with a minimum value of zero and a maximum value of eight). A child achieves a diet of minimum diversity (MDD-C) if she or he consumes from 5 or more food groups in the previous 24 hours prior to the interview.</p><p xml:id="_ffve4DE">Panel A of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">6</ref>.2 shows the average child in the T1 arm consumed from 3.2 groups (min = 1, median = 3, max = 7), while the average child in the T2 and T3 arms who consumed from 3.4 (min = 1, median = 3, max = 7) and 3.9 food groups (min = 1, median = 4, max = 7), respectively. The conditional treatment effect estimates indicate that the mean differences across study arms are statistically different at least at the 10-percent level.

However, in T3, 23 percent of children achieved MDD-C, a level considerably higher than what is observed in the other two study arms. These differences are statistically highly significant.

Lengths/heights and weights were converted to zscores using the 2006 WHO growth standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(WHO 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, de Onis et al. 2007</ref>). These standards allow us to assess child length and weight relative to well-nourished children of the same age and sex, and a Zscore expresses these measures in terms of standard deviations. Children are considered to be stunted (chronically undernourished) if they have a height for age z-score (HAZ) below -2.0, and this chronic undernutrition reflects the negative effects of continued inadequate food intake together with repeated infection. In a healthy and well-nourished population less than 2.5 percent of the children have HAZ&lt;-2.</p><p xml:id="_XRabvGe">Linear growth faltering is a long-term process and therefore we do not expect to see impacts on HAZ or stunting prevalence in this midline assessment. We begin by reporting full HAZ distributions for each treatment arm in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">6</ref>.7. All three distributions lie at the left-hand side of the HAZ distribution of the reference group, indicating widespread growth faltering among the children in our sample. The distributions mostly lie on top of each other, though the T3 distribution is slightly further to the right than the other two, suggesting slightly less growth faltering among children in T3 arm. Similarly, the mean HAZ scores are slightly lower in T3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">6</ref>.8), though the differences to the other arms are at best only weakly statistically significant (p&lt;0.10). The unconditional treatment effect estimates reported in Row 5b in Table <ref type="table">A3</ref> in the Appendix indicate a slightly smaller difference between T3 and T1 as well as T3 and T1 arms. As a result, all (unconditional) differences turn insignificant. Note: N = 2,226 children. 'Reference' is a normal distribution with a zero mean and standard deviation of one.

The child stunting prevalence is 37 percent in T1 arm and 38 in T2 arm. Meanwhile, 35 percent of the children in T3 arm are classified as stunted. The conditional treatment effect estimates indicate that the difference between T1 and T3 arms is not statistically different from zero (p = 0.154). However, the difference between T2 and T3 arms is statistically different from zero (p &lt; 0.05). The unconditional treatment effect estimates are slightly smaller and thus the differences across study arms are less likely to be significant.

Children are considered wasted if WHZ &lt; -2. While SPIR may reduce the risk of child wasting, it is not the primary programmatic objective. In addition, our surveys are too infrequent to be able to adequately measure changes in acute malnutrition. Since WHZ and wasting prevalence are highly sensitive to seasonal fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Wells et al. 2019)</ref>, more frequent surveys would be needed to maximize the ability to detect impacts on this outcome. With these caveats in mind, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">6</ref>.10 shows the mean WHZ scores for each study arm. The means in T1 and T2 are -0.53 and -0.61 and the difference between these two arms is not statistically significant. The mean WHZ in T3 is -0.49 and when compared to the mean recorded for T2, the conditional treatment effect estimate indicates that the difference is statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).

CREDI were designed to serve as a population-level measure of ECD for children from birth to age three. The instruments rely exclusively on caregiver reports (typically a parent of the child), and primarily focus on milestones and behaviors that are easy for caregivers to understand, observe, and describe using a yes/no response scale. There are two versions of CREDI. The short form (employed in the present study) creates a summary score for children's overall developmental status, whereas the long form creates domain-specific developmental scores. The short form includes 20 items specific to each six-month age group (0-5 months, 6-11 months, 12-17 months, 18-23 months, 24-29 months, and 30-35 months), and the administration time is on average five minutes. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">12</ref>We used the CREDI Scoring Application to generate raw scores and the norm-referenced Z-scores for overall development for each age band.

A subset of households (30 percent of IMPEL households) is also targeted for a one-time $300 livelihood grant; these are the households identified as the poorest using an asset-based welfare index constructed by the IFPRI team from baseline survey data.</p><p xml:id="_NU6GhpQ">We do not expect to see meaningful impacts on livelihood outcomes within the first year of implementation. Consequently, the impact of the livelihood interventions will primarily be evaluated at endline, in 2025. Considering this, the midline survey instrument collected data on limited set livelihood indicators, primarily household food security indicators: the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), Food Gap, Food Consumption Score (FCS), and Household Diet Diversity Score (HDDS) as well as household consumption that permit us to compute per capital consumption and poverty related outcomes. Here we report the treatment effect estimates on FIES, FCS, household per capita consumption, extreme poverty, and depth of poverty, the five pre-specified livelihood outcomes to be reported at midline (see Table <ref type="table">A2</ref> in the Appendix). It was also pre-specified that we analyze the impact on all livelihood outcomes by pooling the two treatment arms: T2 and T3.

The FIES survey module administered at baseline and endline contained eight 'Yes/No' questions about the household's food security situation.

Each 'Yes' response scores a point, with higher overall scores indicating a worsening food insecurity situation.</p><p xml:id="_QT3bXvv">Using the raw FIES scores, we then categorized households as severely food insecure if they responded 'Yes' seven or eight times out of the eight questions, moderately food insecure if the number of 'Yes' responses was between four and six inclusive, and mildly food insecure if the number of 'Yes' responses was between one and three inclusive. The household is categorized as food secure if they responded 'No' to all eight questions.</p><p xml:id="_QsvRSeD">Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.1 shows the share of households in each FIES category by survey round and study arm. A considerably smaller share of households is categorized as food secure or mildly food insecure in each round. There is also less movement into or out of these two categories. Compared to the baseline, fewer households are categorized as being severely food insecure at midline. It seems that many households in this category have shifted to being moderately food insecure, a group that has increased since the baseline.

The index is based on the household consumption of nine food groups. The weighted index ranges between 0 and 112, with higher scores indicating better food security. Household diets are categorized as 'Poor' if the FCS is below 21, 'Borderline' if the score is above 21 but below 35, and 'Acceptable' if above 35.</p><p xml:id="_KeNybF6">As also found by previous work, the FCS predicts considerably lower food insecurity prevalence than the FIES <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Maxwell, Vaitla, and Coates 2014)</ref>. 15 In both survey rounds, the mean FCS in the sample is comfortably above 35, the 'acceptable' threshold (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.3, Panel A). By midline, we see that the mean FCS improved in both control (T1) and treated (T2 and T3) groups. However, the improvement was larger among the treated households. We estimate an unconditional treatment effect of 4.3 FCS units, showing that SPIR treatments led to an improvement in food security as measured by FCS. Compared to the baseline mean in T1 households, this treatment effect represents approximately a 10 percent increase in FCS.</p><p xml:id="_cznfHvH">Regarding FCS, we observe that the positive effect reported in Panel A is primarily attributed to households in the T3 arm that received maternal cash transfers. The treatment effect estimate for T2 is nearly zero and not statistically significant, while for T3, it is approximately 8 FCS units and highly significant.</p><p xml:id="_3bUqdkN">At midline, nearly 90 percent of the households report acceptable FCS (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.3, Panel B). For both groups, the share of households with acceptable FCS has increased. At the same time, the share of households with a borderline FCS has decreased. However, as indicated by the positive (negative) and statistically significant treatment effect estimate for acceptable (borderline) FCS, the increase (decrease) has been slightly larger among households exposed to the SPIR treatments. The unconditional treatment effect estimates are similar to the conditional ones (Rows 4 to 7 in Table <ref type="table">A4</ref> in the Appendix).</p><p xml:id="_QjjCHfW">14 FCS was incorporated into the food consumption module. For each food item in the food consumption module, respondents were asked if they consumed the item in the past seven days, on how many days they consumed the item and the quantity consumed. We grouped the food items into the FCS food groups and computed the FCS using the responses to the consumption frequency questions. 15 One possible reason for this discrepancy is the thresholds that categorize households with borderline or acceptable food consumption may have been set too low <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lovon and Mathiassen 2014)</ref>. For example, an Ethiopian household that consumes shiro (a traditional dish made of chickpea and butter or oil and eaten with injera) each day of the week would obtain an FCS of 38.5, which is above the 'acceptable' threshold (35).</p></div>

The food gap is not among the primary or secondary outcome indicators in this evaluation, but we will briefly report it here due to its central role in PSNP evaluations. At baseline, the average (mean) food gap among the control households (T1) was 3.5 months, and it had reduced to 3.3 months at midline (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.3). This difference is statistically significant. For the treated households (T2 and T3), the baseline average food gap was 3.5 months, reducing to 3.1 months at midline, also a statistically significant difference.

Detailed overview of household consumption and poverty measurement methods were provided in Appendix A of the baseline report <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gilligan et al. 2023)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_KU7rb2z">To account for inflation between the baseline and midline surveys, we utilized food price data collected in both survey rounds to construct an Ideal Fisher Index for measuring changes in the prices of representative food baskets in each woreda (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Deaton and Tarozzi 2000)</ref>. According to this price index, the average food inflation between the baseline and midline survey in the study area stood at 33 percent, which is in line with the national food inflation estimated by the Ethiopian Statistical Service for the same period (ESS 2023). We applied this food price index to adjust the midline consumption values to baseline (Autumn 2023) price levels. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">16</ref> After this, we followed the same approach outlined in the baseline report to convert the consumption values into 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.</p><p xml:id="_jvYmuhW">Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.4 overlays the distribution of baseline household daily per capita consumption (dashed line) on the 1.90 $PPP poverty line for both groups. We see that many individuals are located just below or just above the poverty line. Consequently, even relatively small changes in average consumption levels are likely to induce shifts in poverty headcounts. By midline, the distribution for both groups (solid line) has shifted left indicating a reduction in average consumption levels and increase in the number of people falling below the poverty line.</p><p xml:id="_mWdvfJc">The reduction in average consumption levels is confirmed in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.5 that compares the mean daily per capita consumption levels by round and treatment status. In T1 households, the mean consumption fell from $1.78 to $1.48 while in T2 AND T3 households it fell from $1.80 to $1.58. The treatment effect based on an ANCOVA estimator with controls is positive and statistically significant, but small in terms of magnitude.

The treatment effect based on an ANCOVA estimator with controls is negative indicating that individuals in SPIR households have slightly lower poverty rate at midline with the difference being statistically significant at the ten percent level.

Apart from changes in consumption patterns, changes in household size or its composition may therefore affect consumption and poverty estimates. This is particularly important here because a large share of the households welcomed a new baby between the baseline and midline surveys. To understand whether the declining consumption levels and rising poverty levels are explained by an increase in household size, we report consumption and poverty estimates based on adult equivalent units, adjusting consumption needs by age and sex.</p><p xml:id="_33JH6SF">Figure <ref type="figure">A7</ref> in the Appendix reports the household size in terms of number of people (Panel A) and adult equivalent units (Panel B). The average household size at the baseline was 5.5 members if we use the number of members definition and 4.1 if we use the adult equivalent definition. The average household size has increased between baseline and midline by 0.4 member or by 0.2 adult equivalents. Irrespective of the definition, the changes in average household size are identical across study arms, indicating that any changes we observed in consumption or poverty indicators must be due to changes in consumed amounts.</p><p xml:id="_Yp4KJyH">Finally, through its impact on the denominator, the use of adult equivalent units will result in higher per capita consumption levels and lower poverty headcount rate than the standard 'number of members' approach. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_36">A8</ref> demonstrates this for per capita consumption. In contrast to Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.5., the mean per capita consumption based on adult equivalent units is above the poverty line at both survey rounds and in both groups. Similarly, the poverty headcount rate is 20-25 percentage points lower if we used adult equivalent units (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_44">A9</ref>) versus number of members (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.6) to define per capita in per capita consumption. However, the trends are not affected by the definition of per capita: the mean consumption levels decreased, and poverty rate increased in both cases. Perhaps more importantly, the findings of the evaluation do not depend on the definition of per capita: the treatment effects remain statistically significant.</p></div>

These households were identified as the poorest, based on an asset-based welfare index created by the IFPRI team using data from the baseline survey. This assetbased targeting process was implemented in all kebeles, including those assigned to T1, although the livelihood grants were not distributed to households in this arm. In this section, we explore heterogeneity with respect to this eligibility. To do so, we classify households eligible for the livelihood grant as 'extremely poor' and those not eligible as 'less poor'. We then conduct separate estimations for these two sub-groups to assess the extent to which the livelihood grant influences the results presented in Sections 6 and 7. To conserve space, our analysis of heterogeneity focuses only on the primary outcomes relevant to this midline assessment: Caregivers' IYCF knowledge, the prevalence of children aged 6-23 months consuming a diet of minimum diversity (MDD-C), and daily per-capita consumptionexpenditure. It is important to note that the study may not have adequate statistical power to assess impacts on these sub-groups.</p><p xml:id="_jXsxHhG">Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">8</ref>.1 reports the results for caregivers' IYCF knowledge, with Panel A focusing on the 'extremely poor' sub-sample and Panel B on the 'less poor' sub-sample. At baseline, the average caregiver in 'less poor' households displays slightly better nutrition knowledge compared to their counterparts in 'extremely poor' households. However, by midline, the differences between the two sub-samples have become negligible. The estimated treatment effects are relatively similar across both sub-samples, although the difference between T1 and T2 arms is not significant for the 'extremely poor' sub-sample.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9." xml:id="_6HJ9KZP">CONCLUSION</head><p xml:id="_ptxaayS">In this report, we present findings from the midline survey conducted as part of an ongoing randomized controlled trial analyzing the effects of SPIR II. The survey successfully re-interviewed 98 percent of the 3,015 sample households interviewed at baseline.</p><p xml:id="_wSJSsnU">Our findings suggest that SPIR II has been characterized by a high level of implementation fidelity. Households in SPIR II kebeles show a high probability of membership in village economic and savings associations; the poorest households targeted for livelihoods grants have received the grants, primarily allocating them to livestock-related activities such as fattening or purchasing more animals. As for the core nutrition interventions, participation in nurturing care groups was high in both treatment arms, ranging between 75 and 89 percent of the households in the T2 and T3 arms, respectively. Over 92 percent of the households in T3 reported receiving maternal cash transfers, aligning with the program design, and caregivers who received maternal cash transfers primarily reported that the funds were directed to child feeding-related expenses.</p><p xml:id="_xrZvp8y">In examining key outcomes of interest, we concluded that the implementation of SPIR II centering around nurturing care groups has led to an increase in nutrition knowledge on the part of caregivers, though the effect is small. For IYCF practices, there is evidence of significantly enhanced feeding practices for children only in the T3 arm, who are more likely to achieve minimum meal frequency and minimum adequate diet. There are no significant treatment effects observed in the T2 arm. Taken together, these findings suggest that enhancing IYCF practices in this context requires addressing constraints related to gaps in IYCF knowledge (via BCC) and the unaffordability of nutritious foods (via maternal cash transfers) simultaneously.</p><p xml:id="_PTPjG8F">As expected, these significant improvements in IYCF feeding practices in T3 arm have not yet translated into substantially better anthropometric outcomes. There is some evidence of a marginally significant reduction in stunting in the T3 arm. At the same time, there is robust evidence of enhanced child development in the same arm. These findings suggest that the nurturing care groups alone may not be sufficient to catalyze a meaningful effect on early childhood health and development outcomes, but in conjunction with maternal cash transfers, they can have positive effects.</p><p xml:id="_5jyDs3M">Anticipating limited impacts on livelihood outcomes in the initial year of implementation, the midline survey focused on a small subset of livelihood indicators. According to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, severe food insecurity decreased from 58 percent at baseline to 43 percent at midline, while moderately food-insecure households increased from 32 percent to 46 percent at midline. The trends in control and SPIR households were similar without statistically significant differences. By midline, nearly 90 percent of households reported an acceptable Food Consumption Score (FCS), up from 75 percent at baseline. Treatment estimates indicate a slightly more improved FCS among SPIR households compared to the control group.</p><p xml:id="_FNn2Wnh">Extreme poverty remains high. In control (T1) households, the mean per capita consumption fell from $1.78 to $1.48 between baseline and midline while in SPIR (T2 and T3) households it fell from $1.80 to $1.58. The percentage of individuals below the $1.90 poverty line increased from 70 percent to 82 percent in T1 households and from 70 percent to 78 percent among households in the pooled treatment arms (T2 and T3). A The differences in consumption and poverty trends are small between control and SPIR households, indicating that the SPIR livelihood programming did not meaningfully impact these outcomes between baseline and midline. Furthermore, additional analysis that separates the T2 and T3 arms indicates that the positive effects on livelihood outcomes are predominantly attributed to households in the T3 arm, which received the maternal cash transfers.</p><p xml:id="_8prsYH9">Further data collection and analysis at endline (scheduled in 2025) will allow us to evaluate whether the effects on IYCF practices observed at midline have generated larger effects on anthropometric outcomes at endline; and to assess the ongoing effects on livelihoods-related outcomes.</p><p xml:id="_hrpbTrc">Arm Coefficient Standard error p-value N T3-T1 -1.92 2.69 0.48 2,226 T3-T2 -2.67 2.77 0.34 2,226 6b) % of children stunted, conditional estimates T2-T1 1.04 2.34 0.66 2,226 T3-T1 -3.30 2.31 0.15 2,226 T3-T2 -4.34 2.18 0.05 2,226 7a) Mean weight for height Z-score, unconditional estimates T2-T1 -0.079 0.067 0.241 2,226 T3-T1 0.039 0.064 0.547 2,226 T3-T2 0.118 0.068 0.086 2,226 7b) Mean weight for height Z-score, conditional estimates T2-T1 -0.088 0.056 0.115 2,226 T3-T1 0.052 0.056 0.355 2,226 T3-T2 0.140 0.055 0.011 2,226 8a) % of children 6-23 months wasted, unconditional estimates T2-T1 1.83 1.47 0.213 2,226 T3-T1 0.50 1.22 0.678 2,226 T3-T2 -1.32 1.54 0.392 2,226 8b) % of children 6-23 months wasted, conditional estimates T2-T1 2.35 1.26 0.063 2,226 T3-T1 0.43 1.16 0.714 2,226 T3-T2 -1.93 1.36 0.159 2,226 Note: Conditional regression estimates control for household size at baseline, primary female's age and education level at baseline, index child's sex and age and strata fixed effects.

Across all these outcomes, we see that the T3 households perform better at midline as compared to the T1 and T2 households that did not receive maternal cash grants. These maternal cash transfers were approximately 20 USD per month while the average household size in our sample is 5.8 members. Therefore, a monthly transfer of 20 USD per household translates into 3.5 USD per member per month, or 0.11 USD per person per day. Meanwhile, the average household in T3 arm report 0.11 to 0.12 USD-PPPs higher per capita consumption compared to the average household in T1 and T2 arm, respectively. While we should be cautious when comparing USDs expressed in market exchange rates to USDs expressed in PPP exchange rates, the maternal cash transfers do seem to show up in the T3 consumption levels relative to the other two arms.</figDesc></figure>

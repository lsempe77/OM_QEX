<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1." xml:id="_cw7GuDj">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_tzRj6cz">Many development programs seek to improve gender equality by directly empowering women through investments in human capital, access to resources, or productive livelihood options. While several indicators point to growing improvements in gender equity in recent years, with increased girls' school enrollment and women's labor force participation, an area where gender inequality broadly persists is in the home. Even when both husband and wife work outside of the home, women often perform a larger share of home-based domestic tasks. In many settings, social norms around gender roles play a large part <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jayachandran, 2021)</ref>. These restrictive gender norms can lead to inefficient allocation of household labor that is neither Pareto-efficient for maximizing the individual utility of household members, nor for maximizing household joint-production functions such as in agricultural production or in raising healthy, well-educated children <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Couprie et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Duflo &amp; Udry, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Udry, 1996)</ref>. Moreover, these restrictive gender norms persist over long time horizons and intergenerationally even outside of original country settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Alesina et al., 2013)</ref>. However, until recently, development programs tended to work around restrictive social norms instead of directly targeting them.</p><p xml:id="_PMbeAYZ">In this paper we examine the impact of a graduation model program designed to address multiple constraints trapping households in poverty, including restrictive gender norms. The graduation program, Strengthen PSNP Institutions and Resilience (SPIR), provided multi-sectoral livelihoods and nutrition support to more than 150,000 food insecure households who were clients of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP). Approaches to promote gender equity were mainstreamed throughout SPIR activities, including bringing men and women together in Village Economic and Social Associations (VESAs). These served as a platform for facilitated discussions around financial literacy, savings and credit, income generating activities, and gender equitable norms. Moreover, as a part of its men's engagement strategy, SPIR formed men's engagement groups to provide an opportunity for men to critically reflect on traditional gender roles and explore the positive and perceived negative effects of male involvement in tasks traditionally assigned to women.</p><p xml:id="_8TjS3kE">Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, we investigate whether SPIR improves men's gender equitable attitudes and behavior. We take advantage of three rounds of data (baseline, 1-year follow-up, 3year follow-up) and the timing of the men's engagement groups to identify the added impact of the men's engagement groups. We find that, at 1-year follow-up, SPIR leads to improvements in men's gender equitable attitudes and their involvement in household tasks. By 3-year follow-up, only treatment arms with the men's engagement groups continue to have significant impacts. Impacts at 3-year follow-up for the treatment arms with the men's engagement groups are large and range from 0.26 to 0.29 standard deviations (SD) for men's reported involvement in household tasks. Similar increases are found from women's reports of their partner's behavior, alleviating worries of selfreporting bias. Impacts on gender equitable attitudes are smaller in magnitude, ranging from 0.07 to 0.14 SD. For both set of outcomes, impacts at 3-year follow-up in the treatment arms receiving the men's engagement intervention are significantly different from the arm that did not receive the intervention. Thus, we attribute the sustained or larger impacts at 3-year follow-up to the men's engagement groups, which were rolled out after the 1-year follow-up survey.</p><p xml:id="_5447fCs">Our findings contribute to the recent literature on the importance of men's engagement strategies in achieving improved gender equity and related outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Glinski et al., 2018)</ref> including RCTs evaluating the impact of these interventions on gender attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dhar et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nguyen &amp; Tarp, 2022)</ref>, intimate partner violence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramsky et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Christofides et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Doyle et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hossain et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sharma et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Vaillant et al., 2020)</ref>, HIV-prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Jewkes et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sharma et al., 2020)</ref> and family planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Raj et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shattuck et al., 2011)</ref>. We contribute to this literature in three notable ways. First, in contrast to the studies mentioned above, we study a men's engagement intervention in the context of a multicomponent antipoverty program. Second, while gender equitable approaches were mainstreamed into different program components, the men's engagement activity is lighter touch in terms of the total number of sessions than most of those mentioned above and implemented at a larger scale. 1  Whether a lighter touch men's engagement intervention can still lead to changes in attitudes and behaviors is a policy relevant question for changing norms at scale. Lastly, there are only a few experimental studies that include outcomes related to men's involvement in household tasks and even fewer that include both women's and men's reports. 2  We also contribute to the literature on graduation model programs which generally find mixed results on women's empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Banerjee et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bossuroy et al., 2022)</ref>. One potential reason is that these graduation model programs do not explicitly seek to improve gender equitable norms, which may create an enabling environment for women. The exception is a recent study of a women-focused graduation program in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which consisted of a 16-week men's engagement program <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Angelucci et al., 2023)</ref>. They find large and significant impacts of the graduation program on consumption, women's employment and finances, empowerment, and health, but no additional effects from the men's engagement program. However, they did not directly report on men's attitudes or behaviors, and thus we do not know whether the male engagement component shifted these more proximal outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2." xml:id="_xfbfyab">Experimental design a) Context</head><p xml:id="_Hryh7GX">The study takes place in rural Ethiopia where gender norms are patriarchal and traditional, with men considered heads of family and the main decisionmakers, while women are expected to be submissive to men <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alemu, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mabsout &amp; van Staveren, 2010)</ref>. Qualitative work on the study sample reveals that men and women find physical violence acceptable as a form of disciplinary action when women do not complete their household responsibilities or obey their husband <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ranganathan et al., 2022)</ref>. While the social acceptability of gendered violence is slowly decreasing <ref type="bibr">(CSA and ICF, 2016)</ref>, a third of men and more than one half of women in the study sample believe a husband is justified beating his wife under some circumstances, including perceived negligence of domestic duties such as burning food or neglecting children <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alderman et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_2TEBp7d">In terms of gender roles, women are responsible for domestic chores and men responsible for farm activities, to which women and children also contribute <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Tefera, 2020)</ref>. According to the Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (2014), 94 percent of rural women were involved in domestic activities, spending an average of about 5 to 6 h per day. Although many men are accepting of men contributing to domestic chores, they significantly underestimate how widely this view is shared among their peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mccullough et al., 2022)</ref>. Still, only one third of men in rural Ethiopia are reported by their spouses to help with household chores, and when they do, this is a rare occurrence <ref type="bibr">(CSA and ICF, 2016)</ref>. In our sample, only one fifth of women report that their spouses help with household chores <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alderman et al., 2021)</ref>. The PSNP provides cash and/or food transfers to the poorest 10-15 percent of households in food insecure areas as payments for seasonal labor on public work sites or as direct support to vulnerable households who are unable to provide labor contributions. SPIR was a multisectoral graduation program that supported implementation of the fourth phase of the PSNP as well as provided complementary livelihood, nutrition, and gender equity activities to strengthen the program and expand its impacts. SPIR provided support to over 150,000 PNSP households in 15 food insecure districts in the Amhara and Oromia regions.</p><p xml:id="_KPc3PVJ">The SPIR program was organized around a core set of livelihood and nutrition activities designed with gender equity considerations in mind, as well as specific interventions designed to reduce restrictive gender norms. The core livelihood activities (L) were centered around VESAs, supporting group saving and lending activities as well as providing a platform for gender dialogues and trainings on income generating activities and financial literary. 3 The core nutrition activities (N) included nutrition behavior change communication (BCC) and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) activities. For learning purposes, SPIR introduced enhanced models of both the livelihood and the nutrition activities. The enhanced livelihood activity (L*) added a one-time livelihood transfer to the core L activities. The livelihood transfer was valued at $374 USD and randomly assigned to be cash or an equivalent value in poultry, provided to the poorest 60 percent of households in the study sample. The enhanced nutrition activities (N*) added to the core N activities more 1 Most of the interventions cited above were time intensive with 14-16 sessions lasting 2-3 h each (38 -48 h total), while the lighter touch men's engagement intervention studied here consisted of 8 sessions lasting about 2 h each (16 h total). Also in these studies, the number of men assigned to the treatment were typically 500-800, while more than 14,000 men were invited to participate in the men's engagement groups in SPIR.</p><p xml:id="_n6NugkR">2 A men's engagement intervention to improve health outcomes in Rwanda found a greater sharing of childcare and household tasks reported by both men and women at endline, but no statistically significant reduction in women's time spent on these tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Doyle et al., 2018)</ref>. Two studies to reduce IPV through male engagement interventions found that although the interventions had no significant impact on IPV, the interventions did improve men's engagement in household tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hossain et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Vaillant et al., 2020)</ref>. In Ethiopia, a gender transformative intervention to reduce IPV was tested with men's groups, women's groups, and couples' groups, and, while finding mixed results on IPV, women reported an increase in male involvement in childcare and household tasks in the couples' treatment arm, but these effects were not statistically significant in other treatment groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Sharma et al., 2020</ref>).</p><p xml:id="_ubq4FYj">3 Over 5,000 VESAs were formed with more than 117,000 members, including both husband and wife from PSNP households. Depending on the size of the sub-district administrative unit (kebele), between 10-25 VESAs were formed per kebele.</p><p xml:id="_rm6SHm5">targeted nutrition counseling for pregnant and lactating women called timed and targeted counseling (TTC), a 2-week community-based participatory nutrition promotion (CPNP) activity for caregivers with underweight children, men's engagement groups, and Interpersonal Psychotherapy in Groups (IPT-G) for women who were screened for elevated depressive symptoms at 1-year follow-up. 4   ii. VESA gender dialogue</p><p xml:id="_4NZUs4D">The gender dialogue sessions that were part of VESAs included 6 discussion sessions on 1) workloads of men and women, 2) cooperation and sharing household work; 3) household decision making; 4) improved listening, communication and understanding skills; 5) engaging men in childcare work; and 6) identifying restrictive social norms related to women's mobility. These one-hour discussions were incorporated into the bimonthly VESA meetings facilitated by SPIR Community Facilitators or VESA volunteer facilitators. Sessions were designed to engage women and men through activities that lead to reflection about their own situations. At 1-year follow-up, self-reported male participation in VESAs was about 50 percent and of these about 44 percent reported discussing topics related to gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alderman et al. 2020)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_6rpHxTF">iii. Men's engagement groups The men's engagement activity consisted of eight sessions that facilitated men's reflections on gender norms in their community and sharing their own beliefs or opinions on gender-related expectations and roles. The sessions covered topics on gender roles, power and early marriage, father's legacy, caregiving, and nutrition. The session on father's legacy challenged men to identify things they would wish to emulate from their fathers and areas they would want to change in their own role as fathers. They also role-played doing household chores that are predominantly performed by girls or women and were challenged to try these out in their own home. Men later shared their experiences together in the group and encouraged and challenged each other to increase their efforts and continue practicing these actions in their home. While the sessions begin by creating awareness of the unequal workload and unfair burden of household tasks that rest on women, the motivation for men to engage in supporting these chores comes both from a sense that the status quo is unfair and a sense that they will themselves benefit from becoming a supportive partner and more attentive father.</p><p xml:id="_xe9H9Gw">Men's engagement groups were facilitated by men's group facilitators (MGF) and male advocators. Following consultations with VESA members and kebele administration leaders, two male advocators per group were selected by MGFs based on their potential to become role models of attitude and behavior change in their communities. One of the key responsibilities of the male advocators was to support the MGFs with the co-facilitation of the men's engagement group. With the goal of establishing 7-8 men's engagement groups in a kebele, between 14-16 male advocators were selected per kebele, and provided with a 3-day orientation and training on the men's engagement methodology and lessons. Afterwards, men's engagement groups were formed, each consisting of 20 men, including the male advocators. As PSNP client households only represent the poorest 10-15 percent of households in a community, SPIR intentionally broadened the scope of the men's engagement intervention to include both PSNP and non-PSNP men in an effort to achieve a community-level 'tipping point' to shift attitudes and norms around men's involvement in household chores. Influential community members such as local elders, religious leaders or kebele officials were also invited to participate. These groups typically met twice per month. According to the 3-year follow-up survey, about 40 percent of men in N* kebeles reported attending at least one men's engagement session in the last 12 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alderman et al., 2021</ref>). 5 c) Experimental design</p><p xml:id="_4gGMWcR">The study was designed as a cluster RCT to test the impact of multisectoral graduation models that differ in the intensity of livelihood and nutrition interventions. The RCT included 192 sub-districts (kebeles), which were stratified by districts (woredas), and randomized to one of the four intervention arms listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. 6 All intervention arms consisted of households that received the PSNP. In addition, T1 included the enhanced set of livelihood and nutrition activities (L*+N*); T2 included the enhanced livelihood activities and core nutrition activities (L*+N); T3 included the core livelihood activities and enhanced nutrition activities (L+N*); and T4 was the control arm who received the PSNP only.</p><p xml:id="_b5xh5MQ">For this paper, we are interested in the impact of the three treatment arms (T1, T2, T3) compared to the control arm on men's gender equitable attitudes and behavior. All three treatment arms received PSNP and the core nutrition and livelihood interventions which included the VESA gender dialogue. In addition, we are interested in the added impact of N* activities in T1 and T3, which include the men's engagement groups. While most livelihood and nutrition activities started before the 1-year follow-up survey, two enhanced nutrition (N*) activities (men's engagement groups and IPT-G) started after the 1-year follow-up survey. 7   iii. Data and empirical strategy a) Data collection Table <ref type="table">1</ref> Study intervention arms and livelihood and nutrition components.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Intervention arms PSNP L (VESA þ training on gender) N (nutrition BCC þ WASH) L* (livelihood transfer) N* (TTC þ CPNP þ men's engagement þ IPT-G)</formula><p xml:id="_kfG5Kke">T1: L* and N* X X X X X T2: L* and N X X X X T3: L and N* X X X X T4: Control X Notes: PSNP=Productive Safety Net Program; L=Livelihood; N=Nutrition; L*=Enhanced livelihood; N*=Enhanced Nutrition; VESA=Village Economic and Social Associations; BCC=Behavior Change Communication; WASH=Water, sanitation, and hygiene; TTC=Time and Targeted Counseling; CPNP=Community-based Participatory Nutrition Promotion; IPT-G=Interpersonal Psychotherapy in Groups. 4 Alderman et al (2024) have referred to these core and enhanced nutrition models as CN and EN respectively.</p><p xml:id="_2pUZxHm">5 While these self-reports line up with estimates from administrative data for N* kebeles, we believe respondents in the N arm had trouble distinguishing men's engagement groups from other discussions in the VESA groups leading to high rates of self-reported participation in the N arm as well (33 percent). 6 The study originally included 196 kebeles, but 2 were dropped for not having PSNP clients and 2 for security reasons. 7 In addition, due to budget considerations, men's engagement groups within N* were randomly rolled out, with half of the N* kebeles starting men's engagement groups in December 2019 and the second half of N* kebeles started between June-December 2020. We find no differential effects with respect to the timing of the rollout.</p><p xml:id="_qJE4EAg">The SPIR impact evaluation included three rounds of data collection; the baseline survey was conducted from February to April 2018, the 1year follow-up survey from July to October 2019, and the 3-year follow-up survey from February to April 2021 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The sampling frame included 192 study kebeles, from which households were randomly selected based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) be a PSNP client household, (2) have at least one child aged 0-35 months (index child), and (3) have the mother or primary female caregiver of the 0-35-month-old child be a member of the household. The last two criteria enabled measurement of maternal and child nutrition, primary outcomes in the overall evaluation. In total 3,314 households were interviewed at baseline, of which 3,220 households were re-interviewed at 1-year follow-up. In addition, 748 supplemental households were added to the 1-year follow-up sample, for a total of 3,968 households at 1-year follow-up. These supplemental households were sampled based on the same criterion as above, with the exception that the index child must be under the age of 2 years. The 3-year follow-up survey sought to re-interview all households in the 1-year follow-up sample as well as any baseline household that was not available at 1-year follow-up but deemed likely to be available at 3-year follow-up. 8 Of the 3,996 households in the 3-year follow-up target sample, 3,812 were located and interviewed.</p><p xml:id="_7mfjgnD">In all rounds, the questionnaire was structured in three parts: a brief household-level questionnaire for identification and household demographics, a male respondent questionnaire and a female respondent questionnaire. The female questionnaire was administered to the mother or primary female caregiver of the index child ("primary female") and the male questionnaire was administered to her husband or partner ("primary male"). In households with a single adult female and no adult male, some of the modules for the primary male respondent were skipped. Each survey respondent was surveyed separately and provided informed oral consent. 9 b) Outcomes of interest Our main outcomes of interest are men's involvement in domestic tasks and men's gender equitable attitudes. Questions related to men's involvement in household domestic activities were asked of both the primary male and female. Men were asked about whether they helped with the following three activities in the last three days: household chores, meal preparation and cooking, and collecting firewood and water. 10 Women were asked to report their spouse's involvement for the same three activities. We create three binary indicators that equal one if the primary male reports being involved in the specific activity. Given that men's responses may be subject to social desirability bias, we also create three binary indicators that equal one if the primary female reports her spouse was engaged in the specific activity.</p><p xml:id="_g3Z3j8y">We also construct three different indicators of equitable gender attitudes. The first is from a list of five questions asked to the primary male on whether a husband is justified in beating his wife under different circumstances: going out without telling him, burning the food, neglecting the children, arguing with him, and refusing to have sex with him. We create a binary indicator that equals one if the respondent says a husband is not justified in beating his wife under any of the five circumstances. The second is from a list of three questions on whether it is acceptable for a woman to travel alone to different places: market, friends/family, health center. We create a binary indicator that equals one if the primary male respondent says it is acceptable for a woman to travel alone to the three specified places. Lastly, we ask the primary male whether they agree with five gender inequitable statements (such as whether "Changing diapers, giving a bath, and feeding kids is only the mother's responsibility" or "A woman should obey her husband in all things") where the responses range from strongly disagree (0) to strongly agree (4). 11 Scores are reversely coded and summed up so that a higher score implies more equitable gender attitudes, ranging from 0 to 20.</p><p xml:id="_qAJyJgU">In addition to the individual indicators on men's self-reported engagement in household tasks and men's gender equitable attitudes, we create summary indices for the two families of outcomes following <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kling et al.

Analyzing summary indices has several advantages including reducing the probability of a false discovery by reducing the number of distinct hypothesis tests conducted, and providing more power to detect impacts as it can reduce the random error from each individual indicator <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Anderson, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>

For the main analysis we 8 Those deemed unlikely were households that permanently moved away or experienced the death of the primary respondent(s). 9 Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at IFPRI for each round of data collection and from the IRB at Hawassa University in Ethiopia for the 1-year and 3-year follow-up surveys. 10 While the question on household chores does not explicitly exclude the other activities, the only example given is cleaning. The exact question states, "In the past 3 days, did you help with household chores, such as cleaning?". 11 The 1-year follow-up questionnaire includes 10 statements, but for consistency, we use only the 5 statements that were also used at 3-year follow-up.</p><p xml:id="_3Xg23Jy">use the unbalanced panel sample that includes all primary males available at each time period, as this gives us the most power to detect impacts. However, we also conduct the analysis on the balanced sample of primary males that were available at 1-year follow-up and 3-year follow-up as a robustness check. Appendix Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> illustrates the sample of primary males surveyed across all three rounds of data collection. At baseline there are 2,813 primary males, of which 2,393 are reinterviewed at 1-year follow-up in addition to 689 primary males that were added to the sample (600 from the supplemental sample and 89 from households without a primary male at baseline) for a 1-year followup sample of 3,082 primary males. Of the 3,082 primary males at 1-year follow-up, 2,275 were resurveyed at 3-year follow-up, plus 128 primary males from baseline that were not available at 1-year follow-up and 60 men supplemental sample not available at 1-year follow-up, for a total sample of 2,463. While attrition of households in our sample is low (only 2.8 percent of baseline households attrited by 1-year follow-up and only 4 percent of households attrited from 1-year follow-up to 3-year follow-up), attrition of the primary male in the household is higher; 15 percent of primary males attrited from baseline to 1-year follow-up, and 26 percent attrited from 1-year follow-up to 3-year follow-up. According to field reports the main reason men were not surveyed at 3-year follow-up was that they were absent due to work. We analyze attrition by estimating two regressions, 1) regressing a binary variable for attrition on binary variables for treatment arms; and 2) regressing baseline characteristics on attrition, binary variables for treatment arms, and the interaction of attrition with treatment arms.</p><p xml:id="_XsVcAbJ">We find that at 1-year follow-up there is no differential attrition across treatment and control arms, however, at 3-year follow-up, those in the treatment arms are less likely than the control arm to attrit; across treatment arms attrition does not differ (Appendix Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). We find little evidence of selective attrition from baseline to 1-year follow-up (Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>) or baseline to 3-year follow-up (Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>); at 1-year follow-up those that attrit from T1 are older and more likely to be head of household compared to those that stay in T1 (column 5), however, baseline characteristics are balanced across treatment and control arms for those that remain in the sample (columns 2-4). The main exception is that primary males in T3 are less likely than the control arm to find violence is not justified in any of the stated situations.</p></div>

T1 kw is an indicator for whether kebele k was randomly assigned to treatment T1 which includes L*and N* activities, T2 kw indicates the randomized assignment to T2 which includes L* and N activities, and T3 kw indicates the randomized assignment to T3 which includes L and N* activities. We control for design features of the study including a vector of woreda fixed effects, μ w , which is the level of stratification used in the randomization, and a vector of indicators, X 0 ikw , for whether the household is part of the supplemental sample, whether it is the poorest 60 percent eligible for livelihood transfers as part of L*, and whether it was included in the first or second phase of the men's engagement group rollout (3-year follow-up only specifications). β t 1 , β t 2 and β t 3 provide ITT estimates of the impact of T1, T2, and T3 respectively in each time period. We test for the equality of coefficients to see if impacts vary by treatment arm. At 3-year follow-up we are particularly interested in whether impacts from treatment arms with N* (β t 1 and β t 3 ) are significantly different from impacts from treatment arms with only N (β t 2 ). We also test for equality of coefficients across rounds, to see if impacts vary across rounds.</p><p xml:id="_r3F2P6Z">All estimates cluster standard errors at the kebele level. In addition, for specifications on individual indicators, we correct for multiple hypothesis testing using an approach introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Simes, 1986)</ref>, which adjusts inference for the multiplicity of tests estimated, resulting in a modified measure of statistical significance, the sharpened q-value.

Impacts do not vary across treatment arms at 1-year follow-up, suggesting that the core SPIR activities which include the VESA gender discussions improved men's self-reported behaviors. By 3-year followup, only T1 (which includes L* and N*) and T3 (which includes L and N*) still have positive and significant impacts on men's engagement in domestic tasks that range from 0.26 to 0.29 SD. The magnitudes of impact of T1 and T3 are similar, while the magnitudes of impact of T1 compared to T2 (which includes L* and N), and T3 compared to T2 are significantly different at 3-year follow-up, suggesting that N* is leading to larger impacts compared to the treatment arm without N*. For T1, impacts are significantly larger at 3-year follow-up compared to 1-year follow-up.</p><p xml:id="_R88BPCr">We next look at the individual indicators that make up the summary index for men's engagement in domestic tasks. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> presents the impact estimates on men's self-reported engagement in household chores, cooking/meal preparation, and collecting water/firewood at 1year follow-up (columns 1-3) and 3-year follow-up (columns 4-6), and reports tests of equality across rounds (columns 7-9). At 1-year follow-up all three treatment arms lead to significant improvements in men reporting that they helped cook and collect firewood/water. Point estimates range from 4.6 percentage points to 9.7 percentage points with a sharpened q-value that ranges from 0.00 to 0.11. At 3-year follow-up impacts for T1 and T3 remain significant for all three indicators, while for T2 impacts remain significant only for the indicator on collecting firewood and water. Impacts of T1 and T3 are significantly different from T2 at 3-year follow-up. For T1, impacts at 3-year follow-up are significantly larger than 1-year follow-up across all three indicators, consistent with the pattern on the summary index. Point estimates for the T1 and T3 arms at 3-year follow-up range from 12.7 to 20.8 percentage point compared to control means of 22.7 to 55.1 percent.</p><p xml:id="_RJmfk4T">Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> reveals a similar pattern for the summary index on gender equitable attitudes; at 1-year follow-up all three treatment arms significantly improve men's gender equitable attitudes by 0.08-0.09 SD, again suggesting that it was due to the core SPIR activities that were similar across arms. By 3-year follow-up, only T1 continues to have a significant impact. Impacts of T3 are positive but not significant at 3year follow-up. Importantly, impacts of T1 compared to T2 and T3 compared to T2 are significantly different at 3-year follow-up, again suggesting that N* component is leading to larger impacts compared to N. For T2, impacts are significantly smaller at 3-year follow-up compared to 1-year follow-up, suggesting that without N*, effects found at 1-year follow-up are not sustained.</p><p xml:id="_tmW32A8">Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> presents impact estimates on the individual indicators that make the summary index for men's gender equitable attitudes. At 1-year follow-up, T1 and T2 lead to significant improvements on the total score for men's gender equitable attitudes (column 3), although for T2, the sharpened q-value is 0.23. Impacts range from 0.56 to 0.91 points, which represents an increase of 6-11 percent compared to the mean of the control arm. Impacts on the other two indicators (whether a husband is not justified in beating his wife and whether it is acceptable for women to travel alone) are positive but not significant. Similar to the results on domestic tasks, impacts on gender equitable attitudes do not vary by treatment arm at 1-year follow-up. By 3-year follow-up the impact on the total score of gender equitable attitudes is sustained only for T1 (although the sharpened q-value is 0.33), which is significantly different from that of T2 (column 6). For T2, the impact on the total score of gender equitable attitudes is significantly smaller at 3-year follow-up compared to 1-year follow-up (column 9), consistent with the pattern on the summary index. b) Robustness For both sets of outcomes, we find similar patterns; at 1-year followup all treatment arms improve men's gender equitable attitudes and participation in domestic tasks, but impacts are only sustained and/or improved at 3-year follow-up for the treatment arms with N*. The main difference in the N* component between 1-year follow-up and 3-year follow-up is the men's engagement groups which were rolled out after the 1-year follow-up survey. Below we show that results are robust to alternative hypotheses.</p><p xml:id="_NNuhtjf">One potential alternative reason for the difference in impact estimates between 1-year follow-up and 3-year follow-up is that the sample of men changes across rounds. To ensure our results are not driven by the different sample of men, we run the same analysis only for the sample of men who were included in both the 1-year follow-up and 3year follow-up rounds. Appendix Tables <ref type="table">4</ref> and <ref type="table">5</ref>, reveal that our results are robust to this panel sample.</p><p xml:id="_QDBaj9j">Another potential explanation is that men's behavior did not actually change, and instead their responses were subject to social desirability bias. If this was more likely to occur in the treatment groups with N*, then this could bias our estimates. To investigate whether social desirability bias is likely to be an issue, we estimate impacts on women's  Situations asked about: if wife goes out without telling her husband, if wife neglects the children, if wife argues with husband, if wife burns the food, and refuses to have sex with husband. Notes: Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the kebele level. All models control for woreda level fixed effects, supplemental sample, and sample eligible for livelihood transfers. 3-year follow-up specifications also control for whether the kebele was randomly assigned to the first or second phase rollout of the men's engagement program. P-values are reported in brackets; False Discovery Rate corrected q-values are reported in chevrons and computed by pooling all treatment p-values of a respective round included in the table . Asterisks indicate significance at the 10, 5 and 1 percent level and are calculated with respect to the standard errors.</p><p xml:id="_rFPj9PQ">reports of their partners' behavior. Although women's report of their partner's behavior may also be subject to social desirability bias, we believe this will be more muted given that they did not attend the men's engagement sessions and similar across treatment arms. Appendix Table <ref type="table">6</ref> reveals that at 3-year follow-up, impacts from women's reports of their husbands' behavior are similar to impacts from men's selfreports, and in particular the pattern of large impacts across T1 and T3, but not T2, holds. Lastly, it could be other components of the intervention, and not men's engagement groups, that are leading to improved outcomes at 3year follow-up. One example is the IPT-G intervention that is part of N* that was implemented between 1-year follow-up and 3-year follow-up. Women screened at 1-year follow-up who were found to have mild-tosevere depression were invited to join IPT-G sessions. Although IPT-G was targeted to women and not men, women's improved mental health could affect men's involvement in household tasks. Given that only women with depression were screened into these groups, the percent of women invited to participate in IPT-G in N* communities is low, at 18 percent, so this is unlikely to be driving our results. Regardless, we run the same analysis on the sample of men whose partners were not screened into IPT-G. Appendix Tables <ref type="table">7</ref> and <ref type="table">8</ref> reveal that results are robust to excluding households with women who were eligible to participate in IPT-G. Alternatively, it may be that the other arms were given less attention once the men's engagement groups were rolled out, thus the impacts are due to attention being diverted from N arms to N* arms. Self-reported data suggest that this is not the case, as participation in SPIR activities across all treatment arms increased from 1-year followupto 3-year follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alderman et al., 2021)</ref>. c) Other outcomes While involving men in childcare activities was an integral part of the curriculum in both the VESA gender dialogues and the men's engagement groups, we do not include men's childcare activities in the main analysis as questions regarding childcare were only asked from the subsample of men in each time period who had a child less than 24 months, which is only about a quarter of households by 3-year followup. However, Appendix Table <ref type="table">9</ref> reveals that the magnitude of impact on men's childcare activities is generally small and close to zero suggesting that regardless of the smaller sample, there are no impacts on these indicators. Thus, while SPIR was able to change men's involvement in chores and their attitudes about gender equitable norms, it does not appear to have led to greater participation in childcare activities. One potential reason for why SPIR was not able to change men's behavior with respect to childcare, is that most men were already engaging in childcare activities (80 percent of men in the control group at 1-year follow-up and 98 percent at 3-year follow-up took part in at least one childcare activity in the last 3 days), which suggests there was less room for impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4." xml:id="_6RYtNyD">Conclusion</head><p xml:id="_EwVNYdc">In this paper we investigate the impact on men's gender equitable attitudes and behaviors of a graduation model program designed to address multiple constraints trapping households in poverty, including gender-inequitable norms. We find that at 1-year follow-up all treatment arms lead to improvements in men's gender equitable attitudes and their involvement in domestic tasks. Unfortunately, we cannot disentangle what component or activities lead to the improvements but given that impacts at 1-year follow-up do not vary by arm, we conclude that it is likely not the L* and N* components but instead, the core N and L components that were similar across all arms. By 3-year follow-up, only the treatment arms with men's engagement groups continue to have significant impacts which are large and range from 0.26 to 0.29 SD for men's reported involvement in household tasks. Impacts at 3-year follow-up on gender equitable attitudes are smaller in magnitude and range from 0.07 to 0.14 SD. Across both sets of outcomes, the magnitudes of impact in the treatment arms receiving the men's engagement intervention (T1 and T3) are significantly different than that of the treatment arm that did not receive this intervention (T2). Thus, we attribute the sustained or larger impacts at 3-year follow-up in T1 and T3 to the men's engagement groups which were rolled out after the 1-year follow-up survey. Results are robust to using women's report of their husband's behaviors, a balanced sample, and a smaller sample that excludes households where women were also treated for depression.</p><p xml:id="_AYKPxPE">There are limitations to our study. First, we did not collect detailed time-use data, so we only have information on whether men engaged in the activity (the extensive margin), but not on how long they engaged in the activity (intensive margin). Moreover, we do not have data on women's time use, to better understand if this engagement reduced her burden of engaging in domestic tasks. As Doyle et al (2018) find, a greater sharing of domestic tasks does not necessarily reduce the time burden for women. Second, the sample of households in the study is not a representative sample of households from Ethiopia. Households in the study are PSNP clients with a young child, and thus likely poorer and younger than the average household. Moreover, households with an eligible man interviewed at baseline are different from households without an eligible man; those with an eligible primary male present at baseline are on average larger in size, have a higher level of assets, and the primary female in these households are less likely to be primarily occupied by crop production (Appendix Table <ref type="table">10</ref>).</p><p xml:id="_FEqJt58">Changing attitudes and behaviors around restrictive gender norms faces many challenges, especially in rural settings where traditions are deeply rooted in customs that have persisted for many generations. In terms of challenging traditional gender roles, men may face resistance not only from other men for engaging in these perceived 'women-only' household tasks, but also from women who share similar segregated gender role views. We find that a peer group where men encourage and support each other to redefine traditional gender roles leads to sustained improvements in their gender equitable attitudes and behaviors. Anecdotal evidence from the field reveals that the novelty of seeing men baking the traditional staple food of injera became one of the most talked about signs that traditional gender roles could be challenged. Beyond the timeline of this study, the impact could be even greater if these more equitable gender attitudes and norms are modeled and transmitted to children in these households. Longer term follow-up studies of these men's engagement strategies should be prioritized to determine if these initially promising effects persist over time and intergenerationally. * Note: Supplemental refers to primary males from the supplemental sample; new refers to primary males who were not surveyed at baseline but whose household was surveyed at baseline.</p><p xml:id="_GXd5HHN">Table <ref type="table">A1</ref>.

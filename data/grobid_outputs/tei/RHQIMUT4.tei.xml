<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_J2qfDCy">Conclusions</head><p xml:id="_HbzXTcn">The N* interventions-and to a lesser degree the N interventionshave shown success in increasing exposure to health services including BCC, food demonstrations, and WASH. Similarly, communication measures increased significantly; over half of caregivers for the children found to be underweight participated in camps aimed at addressing malnutrition. These increases reflect the goals of the SPIR design. Nevertheless, the frequency of contacts between households and service providers is less than planned and may indicate start-up processes at the time of the midline. This then provides a basis to expect continued improvements over the SPIR program.</p></div>

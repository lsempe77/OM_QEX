The second most common asset was start-up capital or assets for small businesses but the endline survey did not include information about enterprise assets. Thus, the two asset categories "household durables" and "Ag. tools &amp; structures" mostly closely map into "asset types not part of the program". For simplicity of presentation we include five items as part of household durables that could not readily be classified as a household durable or productive asset. The mean of these "other" items is PPP$87.76 and the results are qualitatively unchanged when classifying them as part of a separate category.

The resulting sum is scaled to reflect monthly consumption at the household level. This is then divided by the number of adult equivalents in the household at the time of survey to produce a per-capita statistic.</p><p xml:id="_tXgBGAX">• Monthly Consumption per Household (PPP$) Total consumption includes spending on education, health, non-food consumibles, and durable goods, as well as calculated value of food consumption. The components are summed and scaled to one months equivalents.</p><p xml:id="_6R2sRQt">• Total Income, Past m (PPP$) Each household respondent with income reported their regular and irregular sources of income. For regular income, respondents provided monthly income, which was multiplied by months to get an annual total. For irregular income, respondents provided minimum and maximum monthly income and the number of months they earned at each rate. Minimum and maximum monthly income were multiplied by the number of months respondents reported earning at each rate. Regular and irregular yearly income was totaled by individual, and then by household to get the final yearly estimate.</p><p xml:id="_ckdeHxw">• Livestock Income, Past m (PPP$)</p><p xml:id="_N9nEGZV">Annual profits from livestock. Profits are [X] -[Y] where X and Y are the reference numbers for livestock revenue and costs, respectively, defined elsewhere in this document.</p><p xml:id="_5258rAB">• Non-Livestock Income, Past m (PPP$) Annual profits from agriculture, business, and paid labor. Profits are [X] -[Y] where X and Y are the reference numbers for agriculture, business, and paid labor revenue and costs, respectively, defined elsewhere in this document.</p><p xml:id="_Erc9aRY">• Food Security Index (z-Score)</p><p xml:id="_nYHQqNH">The food security index is constructed using the following binary variables: no adults have reduced eating or skipped meals in the past year; no adults have adult foregone food for a whole day in the past year; no children have reduced eating or skipped meals in the past year; everyone in the household regularly eats at least two meals a day. All are oriented so that a value of one indicates higher food security, and each is left missing if the question was not answered. Variables are standardized, averaged, and standardized again to create the final index.</p><p xml:id="_XnBQgSZ">• Savings Index (z-Score) Index constructed from total savings amount and total savings deposits in past three months: each variable is standardized using the control group mean and SD, summed and the sum standardized again.</p><p xml:id="_yDTY4aa">• Perceived Economic Status ( -) Respondent self-ranking of "financial situation these days," on a "ladder" with rungs from from to , where the top is "very comfortable" and the bottom is "extremely poor."</p><p xml:id="_eKG5rv6">• Housing Index (z-Score)</p><p xml:id="_cThY3GV">The housing index is constructed using the following variables: number of rooms per-adultequivalent; has roof primarily of concrete; has walls primarily of stone; has a latrine; has done household repairs in the past m; spending on household repairs; plans to do household repairs; uses treated water; and inverse of time to access water. Each variable is translated into a Z-score, then a Z-score of the components is created to form the final index.</p><p xml:id="_gCUpEVU">• Debt Index (z-Score)</p><p xml:id="_kkZ2UKG">The debt index is constructed using the following variables: value of informal loans; value of formal loans; and value of debt. Each variable is translated into a Z-score, then a Z-score of the components is created to form the final index.</p></div>

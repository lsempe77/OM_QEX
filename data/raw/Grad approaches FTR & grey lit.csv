PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The Rural Entrepreneur Access Project (REAP) is an innovative microfinance program that gives ultra-poor women in Northern Kenya the tools they need to graduate from extreme poverty and adapt to a changing climate. We help pastoral women to start small businesses in their communities, so they can earn a sustainable income, pay for food and medical care, send their children to school, survive drought and accumulate savings for long-term family stability. REAP provides a cash grant (seed capital to launch a business), sustained training in business skills and savings, and hands-on mentoring by BOMA Village Mentors to business groups of three women. When the businesses are established and generating profits, typically at five to six months, Mentors work with REAP groups to form BOMA savings associations and work with each savings group for one year.","2012","2025-10-23 15:52:16","2025-10-22 09:41:05","2025-10-23 15:52:16","","","","","","","BOMA (2012)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498828","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\4WPBK75W\BOMA-Sustained-Program-Fact-Sheet-2013.pdf","","P05","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498828","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In May 2016, 750 women across 14 locations were enrolled in REAP through funding by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Putting Women and Girls at the Center of Development Global Grand Challenge. Since May 2016, these 750 women, referred to as the Gates cohort, have formed business groups of three women, received two cash grants valued at KES 20,000 ($200 USD) and KES 10,000 ($100 USD), received one year of mentorship from a local BOMA mentor, and formed savings groups that meet monthly. The purpose of this report is to assess the progress these participants have made towards graduating from extreme poverty in the first year of the program. BOMA’s Standard of Living Index (SOLI) survey was administered to participants in the Gates cohort in April 2016, before they were enrolled in the program in May 2016, and again in April 2017, at the program’s midway point. The survey asked participants about their household income, savings, household decision making power, livestock ownership, enrollment of children in school, food security, healthcare use and expenditures. Questions in the midline survey were identical to those in the baseline survey with the exception of questions added about income from the BOMA business, family planning use and phone and M-Pesa usage. Baseline data from a separate cohort of 750 REAP participants enrolled in March 2017 in the same locations is included in this report as a comparison group to ensure that changes observed are specific to REAP participants and are not widespread across the larger population. To determine what progress participants in the Gates cohort have made towards graduating from extreme poverty, the results from the midline survey are compared to results from baseline surveys for the Gates cohort and the March 2017 cohort. At midline, 99.6 percent (249/250) of BOMA businesses are still in operation and 60 percent (151/250) of businesses meet the graduation target of having a business value of at least 125 percent of the initial grant size (KES 37,500). Overall, participants in the Gates cohort reported a 38 percent increase in average household income, from KES 3,655 at baseline to KES 5,041 at midline. The increase in household income was accompanied by a parallel increase in household expenditures. For example, annual school expenses for the Gates cohort increased 31 percent from KES 3,991 at baseline to KES 5,232 at midline, while annual medical expenses increased 21 percent from KES 1,343 at baseline to KES 1,626 at midline. All participants in the Gates cohort reported having savings at midline, compared to only a third of participants in the Gates and March 2017 cohorts at baseline. Participants in the Gates cohort reported an average total savings of 6,815 KES at midline compared with KES 785 and KES 637 at baseline for the Gates and March 2017 cohorts, respectively. This represents an increase in savings of 768 percent over the course of one year for participants in the Gates cohort. The BOMA business, BOMA savings group and personal savings are the primary sources of savings among participants.","2017","2025-10-23 15:52:16","2025-10-22 09:41:05","2025-10-23 15:52:16","","","","","","","BOMA (2017)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498821","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\KQXASVP5\WGCD-BOMA-project-Gates-Midline-Report-9-5-17-2.pdf","","P05","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498821","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To alleviate poverty and food insecurity, particularly in rural areas, in 2006 the social cash transfer Programme SCTP was launched. It has gradually expanded, targeting the ultra-poor (the 10 per cent poorest households in each district) and labour-constrained households. The large scheme, which is heavily funded by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), has significantly improved its beneficiaries’ access to basic goods and services, but so far has had limited effects on their potential to graduate out of poverty in a sustainable manner. For this purpose, the Government of Malawi, the Mwanza District Council, and the Community Savings and Investment Promotion (COMSIP) Cooperative Union, with the support of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) Social Protection Programme, have designed and implemented the Tingathe Economic Empowerment Pilot Project in the district of Mwanza. The pilot programme targets the same beneficiaries as the SCTP and is implemented in six randomly selected clusters (small geographical areas) of the district. The main rationale behind this project is that the root causes of poverty are lack of income and knowledge/access to information. Therefore, the project provides the following three types of services, in addition to the regular SCTP:  Training package: Households in two randomly selected clusters were offered training in group formation, financial literacy and business management. The trainings took place from January to May 2016. The group formation was meant to lead to the formation of COMSIP Village Savings and Loans (VSL) groups. VSL groups, which are widespread in Malawi, pool their savings and give out loans among the group members. On top of the activities of classical VSL groups, COMSIP promotes group business activities within its groups.  Lump-sum payment for business investment: On 15 June 2016, households in another two randomly selected clusters received an additional payment of MWK 50,000,1 which could be used for business investments. This amount is equivalent to about 58 per cent of the 2013 national poverty line (MWK 85,852) and 94 per cent of the ultra-poverty (or food poverty) line (MWK 53,262) (Handa, Mvula, Angeles, Tsoka, & Barrington, 2016).  Lump-sum payment and training: In two other randomly selected clusters, households received both interventions described above. As most of the recipients are labour-constrained, the pilot offers to the main receivers the option to choose a proxy, i.e., someone who attends the training or engages in business activities on their behalf. This is an innovative feature of the project, which sees beneficiaries as potential entrepreneurs or investors, and not just as workers.","2017","2025-10-23 15:52:16","2025-10-22 09:41:05","2025-10-23 15:52:16","","","","","","","Beierl (2017)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498803","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\Z27GKSKJ\die-dp-2017-15.pdf","","⛔ No DOI found; P12","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498803","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach combines multiple interventions with the aim of promoting entrepreneurship among ultrapoor women, and emphasizes cash transfers, in addition to business skills training, business mentoring and savings. The first paper takes advantage of the randomized allocation of beneficiaries of the program to one of three funding cycles to estimate its impact on the welfare of beneficiaries. In the short-to-medium run participation in the program is found to have a positive and significant effect on income, savings, asset accumulation and food security. The second paper looks at the impact of the program on female empowerment, and compares survey measures of empowerment to a measure derived from an incentivized decision making experiment. A positive impact of participation in the program on empowerment is found when using an experimental indicator, but not when using traditional survey measures. The experimental indicator also better correlates with indicators of well-being that are associated with more empowered women and is seen as a better measure of empowerment than survey measures, in this context. The final paper takes advantage of the exogenous assignment of ultra-poor women to business groups to examine the effect of team heterogeneity on an experimental measure of trust. Heterogeneity in many characteristics is not found to affect the level of trust and trustworthiness between business partners. However, differences in asset wealth, measured by livestock ownership, is associated with less trust.","2017","2025-10-23 15:52:16","2025-10-22 09:41:05","2025-10-23 15:52:16","","","","","","","Gobin (2017)","","","","","Monash University","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498819","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\P6UPWQRW\20170403GobinThesis+(1).pdf","","P05","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498819","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over a 4-week period in January and February 2012, we spoke with over 60 women, of who around 35 had participated in the SKS pilot. This study is part of a wider research agenda in which research teams are following up with program members at least a year after the end of the program to understand how sustainable any positive outcomes of the various graduation pilots have been. We begin by describing the graduation model and the conceptual innovations that gave rise to this particular approach to poverty alleviation. Next, we provide a detailed description of the SKS’s Ultra Poor Program and its unique aspects vis-a-vis the other pilots. In the third section, we describe the results of earlier evaluations of the pilot, both quantitative and qualitative. Finally, we present the findings of our research, which was conducted between January and March of 2012. We conclude with recommendations for SKS to consider as it moves forward with scaling up the Ultra Poor Program in other locations. In brief, we find that the sustainability of the program's outcomes has been uneven. While many social and financial behaviors inculcated by the program seem to have dropped off, many members seem to be continuing to benefit from the livelihood aspects of the program. Furthermore, the heightened political energy in Andhra Pradesh has caused disruptions in the microfinance industry and has greatly expanded social safety nets for poor people; both of which have had serious implications for the Ultra Poor Program's target group.","2012","2025-10-23 15:52:16","2025-10-30 16:36:37","2025-10-23 15:52:16","","","","","","","Jawahar (2012)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752222","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\UNISAXHB\sks-upp-evaluation-final-_jawahar-sengupta_.pdf","","P07","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752222","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyze a randomized trial of an innovative anti-poverty program in South India which provides “ultra-poor” households with inputs to create a new, sustainable livelihood. We find no statistically significant evidence of lasting net impact on consumption, income or asset accumulation. Instead, income from the new livelihood substituted for earnings from wage labor. A very similar intervention made a large difference elsewhere in South Asia, however, where wage labor alternatives were less compelling. The analysis highlights the roles of substitution bias and dropout bias in shaping evaluation results and delimiting external validity.","2013","2025-10-23 15:52:16","2025-10-30 16:36:35","2025-10-23 15:52:16","","","","","","","Morduch (2013)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752215        DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.2317322   EPPI-Reviewer Publisher: Social Science Research Network","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\B9FW5V5G\ssrn-2317322.pdf","","SSRN; P07; Jonathan  Morduch; Jonathan Bauchet; Shamika Ravi; Substitution Bias and External Validity; Why an Innovative Anti-Poverty Program Showed No Net Impact","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752215","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design and interventions all sit at the nexus of nutrition, natural resources management (NRM), and climate resilience and will combine BOMA’s REAP for Nutrition adapted poverty graduation model with AWF’s conservation and ecological restoration interventions. This quarter saw the execution of preliminary activities like school and health facility mapping, team on-boarding and training, the recruitment of mentors, and inception meetings with key partners and stakeholders including the Ministry of Health, Agriculture, Water and Natural Resources, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Fisheries, Youth, and Livestock, and the Grevy Zebra Trust.

Available to the public by year-end, the report assesses the progress of 8,700 program households after 18 months of interventions, training, and mentorship. Graduation is achieved when a participant and their household meet the necessary conditions for nutrition resilience. To assess whether a household has graduated, evaluators apply criteria across nutrition, food security, livelihoods, shock preparedness, and social and human capital investment. For a household to be considered as having met the graduation criteria, participants must fulfill nutrition-focused requirements and at least three additional criteria.","2024","2025-10-23 15:52:34","2025-10-22 09:41:05","2025-10-23 15:52:34","","","","","","","BOMA (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498832","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\93TFRS98\BOMA-2024-Q3-Impact-Report.pdf","","P05","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498832","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The equal opportunity view emphasizes that differences in individual traits like talent or motivation make the poor choose low productivity jobs. The poverty traps view emphasizes that access to opportunities depends on initial wealth and hence poor people have no choice but to work in low productivity jobs. We test the two views using the random allocation of an asset transfer program that gave some of the poorest women in Bangladesh access to the same job opportunities as their wealthier counterparts in the same villages. The data rejects the null of equal opportunities. Exploiting small variation in initial endowments, we estimate the transition equation and find that, if the program pushes individuals above a threshold level of initial assets, then they escape poverty, but, if it does not, they slide back into poverty. Structural estimation of an occupational choice model reveals that almost all beneficiaries are misallocated at baseline and that the gains arising from eliminating misallocation would far exceed the costs. Our findings imply that large one-off transfers that enable people to take on more productive occupations can help alleviate persistent poverty.","2020","2025-10-17 17:03:24","2025-10-21 19:06:58","2025-10-16 23:05:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476828","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\S4BHU3WQ\Why-the-poor-stay-poor.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476828","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework consists of a sizable transfer of productive physical capital, coupled with training and continuous support over the course of one or two years. A second and related literature suggests that unconditional cash transfers (UCT’s) may have a comparable eﬀect. This ﬁeld experiment, examining the ﬁrst two years of BRAC’s TUP pilot in South Sudan, oﬀers a direct comparison of these very diﬀerent (but similarly expensive) approaches to alleviating capital constraints. We consider how households’ response to each may be aﬀected by South Sudan’s unique economic conditions in 2014 and 2015, which has faced a level of instability against which TUP framework has not been rigorously studied. We ﬁnd evidence of positive consumption eﬀects from both treatments, but a persistent wealth eﬀect only from the TUP. We also elicit suggestive evidence that BRAC’s support may have helped TUP beneﬁciaries cope with the short-term economic eﬀects of the outbreak of violence in 2014.","","2025-10-16 23:11:27","2025-10-21 19:06:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476823","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\FUEPHVGK\Chowdhury et al. - Valuing Assets Provided to Low-Income Households in South Sudan.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476823","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such trait is transpiration efficiency (TE), which reflects a plant’s ability to use water efficiently. This study tested a core collection of 182 Ethiopian sorghum accessions, representing major races for drought tolerance related traits. The accessions were grown in 16 l lysimeters under a rain-out shelter, employing a randomized complete block design with three replications. Our findings revealed significant genetic variation (p < 0.001) in TE and related traits among sorghum races. Durra races exhibited the highest TE (6–8.5 kg/L), while intermediate races (dura-caudatum, kafir-caudatum, dura-guinea) showed moderate. Conversely, kafir-caudatum, kafir-bicolor, guinea-bicolor, guinea-caudatum, dura-caudatum and bicolor exhibited the lowest TE. Strong correlations were found between TE and traits such as total shoot fresh weight, total shoot dry weight, and leaf number. Principal component analysis identified key traits influencing TE, while cluster analysis grouped accessions into four distinct clusters, with Cluster IV containing genotypes with the highest TE. These findings highlight the potential of TE in breeding water-efficient sorghum varieties and provide valuable genetic resources for enhancing drought tolerance.","2025-07-01","2025-10-17 13:55:36","2025-10-21 19:06:55","2025-10-17 13:55:36","","","","","","","Transpiration efficiency in the major races of Ethiopian sorghum","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476817  Publisher: Cogent OA","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\3TDWAWAT\Mitiku et al. - 2025 - Transpiration efficiency in the major races of Ethiopian sorghum Unraveling genetic variation for d.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476817","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explores the potential for scaling out SLUS from localized interventions to broader landscape-level applications in Colombian cacao agroforestry systems (CAFS). We employ a multi-level framework, integrating qualitative and quantitative data from primary and secondary sources. We apply text mining, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis. First, we identify the interconnections among agro-ecological, biophysical, economic, social, institutional, and political factors influencing the scaling out of SLUS in cacao farming in two municipalities located in conflict-affected Colombian departments. Secondly, we conduct a national quantitative exploratory analysis, grouping similar departments based on socioeconomic and biophysical data from official sources. This analysis provides the foundation for the design of regional typologies and an adaptive pathway for the scaling out of SLUS in cacao farming. This pathway encompasses five distinct departmental groups. Our findings highlight the need for a landscape-based approach that is sensitive to regional socio-cultural and institutional nuances. The analysis reveals that key variables, including land availability for agricultural use, water use risk level, deforestation, social conflict, land tenure informality, and agricultural productivity, influence the successful scaling out process across diverse regions. This study advocates for a collaborative approach that links scientific insights with practical initiatives co-created at the regional level, thereby empowering communities to design pathways for scaling out SLUS across Colombia.","2025-10-01","2025-10-17 14:14:08","2025-10-21 19:06:54","2025-10-17 14:14:08","","","","","","","Toward understanding the scaling out of sustainable land use systems in Colombia","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476812  Publisher: Springer Nature Link","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\I42SLMFQ\Del Rio Duque et al. - 2025 - Toward understanding the scaling out of sustainable land use systems in Colombia Integrating case s.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476812","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Political and cultural structures, both historical and present, that influence people´s access to natural resources and the benefits of economic development from land and agriculture have, under a Mindanao context, exacerbated underlying drivers of conflict.

We find few differences in individual preferences over allocations of goods. However, wives and husbands have strong preferences over process: women prefer to defer decisions to their husbands even when deferral is costly and is not observed by the husband; men rarely defer under any condition. Our study follows a randomized controlled trial that ended a year earlier and gave large cash transfers over eighteen months to half of the women in the study. We estimate the effect of treatment on the demand for agency among women and find that the receipt of cash transfers does not change women’s bargaining process except in a secret condition when the decision to defer is shrouded from her husband. This suggests that the cash transfer to women increases their demand for agency but does not change the intra-household balance of power enough to allow them to express it publicly.","2024-09-13","2025-10-17 14:11:01","2025-10-21 19:06:53","2025-10-17 14:11:01","","","","","","","To defer or differ","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476810  Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\N2C234L8\Bakhtiar et al. - 2024 - To defer or differ Experimental evidence on the role of cash transfers on Nigerian couples’ decisio.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476810","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prompted to rethink its approach in the early 2000s when evaluations revealed that its existing programs to promote food security and livelihoods were not serving the needs of the poorest, BRAC developed a new program that was scaled up nationwide within a few years. Building on the experience and infrastructure of its other programs, BRAC saw its program reach over 2 million households by 2020, with some 100,000 female heads of households accepted into the program each year. Randomized controlled trials of BRAC’s program revealed sizable economic impacts that have been sustained seven years after participants entered the program (Bandiera et al. 2017). This case study explores BRAC’s experience evolving the graduation approach over the last 20 years, paying special attention to the lessons for governments and NGOs alike that have emerged from the most recent periods of implementation. Specifically, this case study looks at how, since the program started in 2002, BRAC has sought to ensure high program quality and maximize sustainable impacts, at scale, in a changing poverty context. By employing a historical perspective from nearly two decades of program implementation, the study reflects the reality that graduation and economic inclusion programs require staying power enabled by long-term investment and innovation supported by research.","2021-01-19","2025-10-16 22:34:31","2025-10-21 19:06:53","2025-10-16 22:34:31","","","","","","","The State of Economic Inclusion Report 2021","","","","","The World Bank","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476809  DOI: 10.1596/978-1-4648-1598-0","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\C5SD99DN\Andrews et al. - 2021 - The State of Economic Inclusion Report 2021 The Potential to Scale.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476809","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2016, Bill Gates promoted investment in chickens as a development strategy that would meaningfully increase incomes for poor women.1 In response, Chris Blattman suggested that large cash grants of the kind provided by Give Directly (Haushofer and Shapiro 2016) may be more effective at enhancing outcomes, given heterogeneity in households’ needs and capacity to raise chickens.2 This learning brief reports on evidence from an ongoing impact evaluation of a complementary program to Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program, Phase 4 (PSNP4), called SPIR (Strengthen PSNP4 Institutions and Resilience) in rural Ethiopia, in which a cross-randomization of interventions providing poultry and cash transfers allows us to generate evidence highly relevant to this debate. The SPIR Development Food Security Activity (DFSA) in Ethiopia is a five-year program (2016–2021) supporting implementation of the PSNP4 as well as complementary livelihood, nutrition, gender, and natural resource management activities intended to strengthen the program and expand its impacts. Under funding from USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and in close collaboration with the Government of Ethiopia, World Vision leads implementation of the SPIR DFSA in partnership with the Organization for Rehabilitation and Development in Amhara (ORDA) and CARE. SPIR DFSA targets more than 500,000 PNSP clients in 15 of the most vulnerable woredas in Amhara and Oromia regions of Ethiopia. SPIR DFSA also incorporates a substantial learning agenda intended to use evidence to improve the design of the DFSA, provide feedback to strengthen its delivery, and draw lessons both for local gov-ernment and other national and international stakeholders. World Vision, ORDA, and CARE provide guidance on the implementation of the learning agenda. IFPRI leads the planning and execution of the learning agenda activities. This learning brief reports midline effects of two specific dimensions of SPIR programming, a poultry package and a one-time cash transfer randomized to women in particularly poor households, on a set of livelihood outcomes measured in the midline survey conducted between July and October 2019.","2020-02-01","2025-10-17 14:25:44","2025-10-21 19:06:50","2025-10-17 14:25:44","","","","","","","The effects of poultry and unconditional cash transfers on livelihoods outcomes","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476799  Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\LMK3TKC5\Leight et al. - 2020 - The effects of poultry and unconditional cash transfers on livelihoods outcomes Evidence from the S.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476799","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forty-eight Bonga ewes (2 -3 BCS and 22 – 37 kg of body weight) grazing on natural pasture were randomly assigned to supplementary treatments consisting of combinations of ‘Areke Atela’ and commercial concentrate (CC): T1 (0 g ‘Atela’ + 450 g CC), T2 (45 g ‘Atela’ + 405 g CC), T3 (90 g ‘Atela’ + 360 g CC), T4 (135 g ‘Atela’ + 315 g CC), T5 (180 g ‘Atela’ + 270 g CC) and T6 (control). The experimental design was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with eight blocks consisting of six ewes per block based on their body weight and body condition score. The sampled ewes were only targeted at Bonga agriculture institution CBBP site owned by breeding program cooperative members and the study spanned 170 days with an additional 15-day adaptation phase, conducted in the Adiyo district Boka village, Kafa zone, southwest Ethiopia region, from 10 August 2023 to January 2024. After feeding for 15 days as an adaptation period, the estrous cycle was synchronized with two intramuscular injections with 11-day intervals, 5 mg PGF2α, before artificial insemination. Semen was collected from top rams using artificial vagina at the day of ewe’s estrus response and immediately inseminated. A general linear model (GLM) procedure of the statistical analysis system (SAS, version 9.3) was used to analyze body weight, body condition score, onset of estrus, duration of estrus, lambs birth weight, litter size, and gestation period. The estrus response rate, conception rate, and lambing rate was analyzed using nonparametric test. The result showed that, the replacement groups significantly increased (p < 0.05) at T2, and T3 demonstrated superior estrous response and pregnancy rate compared with T4,T5 and the controlled group T6. Replacement group (T2, T3) with 45 g Areke Atela + 405 g CC and 90 g Areke Atela + 360 g CC are promising economical feed replacement to increase the reproductive performance of Bonga ewes.","2024-10-30","2025-10-17 14:12:15","2025-10-21 19:06:49","2025-10-17 14:12:15","","","","","","","","","","","","Bonga University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476794","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\ARNFRWU2\Gelaw - 2024 - The effect of graded level replacement of noug seed cake with local brewery residues on reproductive.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476794","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Improved fodder production combined with appropriate postharvest handling practices have been practiced to alleviate the problems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the perception of farmers on improved fodder and quantify the effects of improved fodder in livestock performance, forage yield and quality of intercropped oat-vetch and benefits obtained from the fodder production. The study involved both field observation and questionnaire with 40 purposively selected livestock owners who practiced improved fodder production. The effect of cultivated oat-vetch supplementation on daily body weight gain and milk yield was quantified using 8 oxen, 7 cows and 3 sheep. Forage biomass yield on dry matter (DM) basis was calculated after drying a sample of 300g green forage in an oven at 600c for 48 hours .data analysis for Statistical analysis system (SAS) was used to carry out descriptive statistics on questionnaire data and field observation variables. Feed shortage has been a major constraint for animal production during dry periods and farmers use different coping mechanisms ranging from purchasing of feeds from the market and destocking unproductive animals. The majority of the interviewed households practice irrigation and produce cultivated fodders such as oat-vetch, alfalfa, phalaris and elephant grass. The oat-vetch mixture DM yield in Embahasti (8.71 t/ha) was significantly higher than that in Tsibet (6.48 t/ha), (P<0.05). The mean DM, Ash, OM, CP, NDF, ADF and ADL content of oat-vetch mixture were 94.4, 8.9, 91.1, 11.9, 65.9, 45.9 and 6.1, respectively. The TIVOMD (%) and ME (MJ/kg DM) of oat-vetch mixture were also 60.2 and 8.85, respectively. All respondent farmers replied that supplementation of cultivated fodders to their animals have resulted in positive impact on milk yield, body weight gain, health and coat color of their animals. On-farm observation of the performance of animals indicated that supplemented cows, oxen and sheep were able to gain 293, 265 and 88.9 g of weight per day respectively,. The average daily gain of crossbreed cattle and local cattle breed were 161 and 307g, respectively. Moreover, the oat-vetch supplementation resulted in daily additional milk yield of 2.33 liters per cow for crossbreed cattle, and 1.0 liters per cow for local cattle.

The results of this study, based on a pilot in India, indicate that this intervention succeeds in elevating the economic situation of the poorest. We nd that the program results in a 15% increase in household consumption and has positive impacts on other measures of household wealth and welfare, such as assets and emotional well-being. Our results are consistent with the notion that the wealth transfer, in the form of asset distribution, directly increased consumption among bene ciary households through the liquidation of assets, but other sources of income, notably from small enterprises, appear to have contributed to the overall increase in consumption as well.","2011","2025-10-16 22:35:24","2025-10-30 16:36:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752232","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\WUGBVATU\Banerjee et al. - Targeting the Hard-Core Poor An Impact Assessment.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752232","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social protection programs are essential for supporting Egyptians who are economically the most vulnerable. This brief makes the argument for moving more decisively toward a cash-based social protection system in Egypt. Four areas of action are highlighted: Continue the well-functioning Takaful and Karama program and consider increasing its budget to adjust transfers to inflation. Consider improving the targeting for Tamween food subsidies and integrating Takaful and Karama with Tamween. Continue the use of transparent and independent impact evaluations to assess social protection programs in order to maximize their benefits for Egypt and its people.

However, the intensification of aquaculture systems often has negative environmental outcomes. The adoption of diversification practices (e.g. polyculture, pond-dike cropping (PDC)) and better management practices (BMPs) has been identified as a possible approach to intensify sustainably small-scale aquaculture production. This study assesses the sustainability outcomes of the adoption of diversification practices and BMPs in small-scale production models. We focus on Myanmar, a developing country characterized by a rapidly expanding small-scale aquaculture sector. We analyze 624 household surveys with small-scale aquaculture producers in central and northern Myanmar. We estimate the effects of diversification practices and BMPs on different sustainability outcomes, namely economic outcomes (i.e. aquaculture yield and benefit-cost ratio), environmental outcomes (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency), and food security outcomes (i.e. fish self-consumption and household dietary diversity) through linear mixed-effects models. Our results reveal that diversified production models (whether integrating or not integrating BMPs) could have significant positive effects on economic and food security outcomes, as well as phosphorus use efficiency, compared to 'unimproved monoculture'. However, such production models do not seem to have any major effect on nitrogen use efficiency. The adoption of BMPs on diversified production models seems to have little (if any) added effect on any of the studied sustainability outcomes, which suggests the need to improve existing BMPs or even develop new BMPs fit for Myanmar's context. These findings have implications about the possible contribution of diversification practices and BMPs for enabling sustainable intensification in small-scale aquaculture settings in Myanmar, and other rural developing contexts.","2023-01-03","2025-10-17 14:06:35","2025-10-30 16:36:37","2025-10-17 14:06:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752221  Publisher: IOP Publishing","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\3HSKCJVM\Wang et al. - 2023 - Sustainable intensification of small-scale aquaculture production in Myanmar through diversification.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752221","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their production has negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Certification standards have been promoted as a market-led mechanism to ensure their sustainable production. Even though food security does not feature in the theory of change of most certification standards, there are interesting intersections. This paper assesses the food security outcomes of certification adoption among cocoa and oil palm smallholders in Ghana. We analyse 608 household surveys from two study sites using propensity score matching and multiple standardized metrics of food security such as the Food Consumption Score (FCS), the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and the Coping Strategies Index. Certified cocoa/oil palm farmers are more food secure than uncertified farmers and food crop farmers across most indicators and group comparisons. However, the differences are for most indicators not substantial or statistically significant (except the HFIAS). In fact, 65% and 68% of the certified cocoa and oil palm farmers are vulnerable to food insecurity in terms of the FCS. These results suggest that even though certification adoption can improve the livelihoods and yields of farmers, in reality it has marginal effect on food security. Certification standards would need to emphasize food security in their guidelines, theories of change and support packages to smallholders if they are to enhance food security and have a truly positive effect on the sustainability of cocoa and oil palm production.","2021-05-01","2025-10-17 14:18:54","2025-10-30 16:36:36","2025-10-17 14:18:54","","","","","","","Sustainable but hungry?","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752220  Publisher: IOP Publishing","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\J3QLFMD9\Dompreh et al. - 2021 - Sustainable but hungry Food security outcomes of certification for cocoa and oil palm smallholders.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752220","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we study the factors contributing to the effectiveness of a policy system. The process of policy design, adoption, implementation, and refinement requires an effective policy system as well as a capacitated and supportive institutional structure. External actors both through technical and financial assistance often support policy systems in developing countries. Poor coordination and harmonization of such assistance among various actors and players within the country can often result in undermining the very policy systems they try to strengthen. This is typical in the African agricultural development process. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework for understanding the policy and institutional architecture of food and agriculture policy system and for improving the coordination and harmonization of the roles of policy actors and players. Applying the framework to Ghana, we map and analyze the organizational contributions of various actors and their functional characteristics. We show how such analysis can aid various policy actors in setting priorities and strategies for increasing their capacity and the effectiveness of their roles. Finally, we draw lessons for strengthening the food policy systems in developing countries through effective coordination among local and external actors.","2017","2025-10-17 14:06:38","2025-10-21 19:06:45","2025-10-17 14:06:38","","","","","","","Strengthening and harmonizing food policy systems to achieve food security","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476777  Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\YVF5MYB4\Babu and Blom - 2017 - Strengthening and harmonizing food policy systems to achieve food security A case study and lessons.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476777","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though the known indigenous Fogera breed is also found in this woreda little attention has been given to characterize the milk and meat production systems, to assess the production inputs, to identify the dairy products and beef market chain participants and to identify the main constraints and outline the interventions, it is due to this understanding that the present study was initiated. Twelve sample peasant associations were randomly selected (five from Fogera plain and seven outside of the plain) based on the potentiality of milk and meat production. 480 respondents participated of the study. Different survey techniques; namely focus group discussion, data collection by developing formats, personal observations and administration of semi-structured questionnaires on milk and meat production practices were employed. Findings of focus group discussions revealed that the types of cattle husbandry practices of the respective study sites (PAs) were different between rural and urban areas. Findings from the semi-structured interviews revealed that 98.75 % of cattle milk and meat productions were undertaken by indigenous cattle breeds. The type of husbandry practice was traditional. Furthermore, the respondents were very much interested to improve their local breeds by artificial insemination and natural mating by crossbred bulls to upgrade the milk productivity of the breeds. The number of cattle per household was significantly different among the village (P< 0001). And also the average number of milking cows per household ranges from 1.18 to 2.08. The holding of milking cows per household was 1.59 + 0.04 where as holding of private pastureland was 0.18 + 0.09, thus the lower production of milk per household may be due to insufficient pasturelands and feed scarcity. Milk produced per household was highly correlated (P<0.01) with the number of cows owned by the household and less correlated (P<0.05) with area of pasture owned by the household. The average lactation length for local breeds was 7.5 months and the average daily milk yield was 1.5 liters. Age at first calving was 3-5 years and perhaps due to malnutrition. The reported critical constraints of traditional cattle production were seasonal feed shortage, high disease prevalence challenges, lack of crossbreeds, lack of working capital and lower demand for dairy and beef products due to long fasting periods and lower purchasing power of the consumers.","2006-04-15","2025-10-17 14:01:50","2025-10-30 16:36:34","2025-10-17 14:01:50","","","","","","","Studies on cattle milk and meat production in Fogera Woreda","","","","","Debub University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752212","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\85DL27SI\Anteneh - 2006 - Studies on cattle milk and meat production in Fogera Woreda production systems, constraints and opp.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752212","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ethiopia is committed to setting policy frameworks and implementation strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change and produce a climate change-resilient society. It is well understood that education and climate change have a reciprocal relationship, and education has a strong power for climate change adaptation and mitigation endeavours. Formal and formal education at each stage, from kindergarten to higher learning institutions, contributes to the effort to produce a climate-resilient and climate-literate society. In particular, Universities have a tremendous role in climate change mitigation and adaptation by devising climate-sensitive curricula and capable staff development for teaching climate sciences, conducting climate research, and enhancing climate-oriented community engagement and policy advice based on the research results. In this premise, accelerating the impact of CGIAR climate research in Africa (AICCRA) approached MoE and universities. It created partnerships to galvanize the integration of climate education into university curricula and programs. Various consultations and workshops were conducted to devise a participatory climate education integration approach in Ethiopian public universities through demand-driven gap analyses. The gap analyses have culminated by producing policy briefs that have also suggested recommendations. The policy brief was submitted to the Ministry of Education. The gap analyses of the freshmen curricula and climate discipline-oriented courses offered in Universities have gaps in capturing contemporary climate knowledge products. The policy brief also demonstrated that, Ethiopia's educational strategic roadmap omitted the crucial ""Climate Basics"" course, leaving a significant knowledge gap among its students. The policy brief suggested that Ethiopian Universities should install climate basics in freshmen programs as a common and compulsory course through the participation of key stakeholders. A one-day workshop was conducted by engaging multiple stakeholders on September 25, 2023, to install climate basics in freshmen curricula as a compulsory course. More than 60 professionals representing different organizations participated in the workshop. Presentations were made to know the interests and aspirations of professionals/institutions representing different climate-sensitive intuitions, including the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Planning and Development, Ethiopian Metrology Institute, Agricultural Transformation Institute, Disaster Risk Management Institute, Universities, UNESCO, EPA, and ILRI-AICCRA. The Presentations in one accord have recommended the integration of climate Basics in the freshman program as a compulsory and credited course. The interactive workshop demonstrated Ethiopia's decision to prioritize climate education as a testament to its commitment to tackling the climate crisis head-on. By equipping its future generations with the knowledge and tools to address climate-related challenges, Ethiopia is poised to become a regional and continental leader in building a climate-resilient future. It was noted from the workshop that the implementation strategies need to be devised by engaging conference organizers as lead actors. As per the recommendations of the workshop participants, MoE, UNESCO, EPA, and AICCRA should discuss and persuade the government to implement the recommendations by scanning opportunities and Ministry of Education programs in making our curricula dynamic and appropriate to the changing global world and contribute Ethiopia’s commitment to implement climate resilient and green economy.","2023-12","2025-10-17 14:00:12","2025-10-21 19:06:44","2025-10-17 14:00:12","","","","","","","Streamlining Climate Education to Tackle Climate Crisis","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476775  Publisher: Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\FBGUKIKZ\Belay et al. - 2023 - Streamlining Climate Education to Tackle Climate Crisis Call For Action to Empower Ethiopia’s Next.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476775","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is estimated at 105 million tropical livestock units, which includes 49.3 million heads of cattle, 47 million heads of sheep and goat, 8.3 million equines, 760 thousand camels and a poultry population of 38.13 million. The sector contributes to the livelihood of 60-70% of the Ethiopian population - this translates into approximately 44-52 million people whose subsidiary needs and economic activities rely on livestock production. Understanding the spatial distribution of livestock species is crucial in order to devise a feasible and geographically targeted livestock development policy. The aim of this study is to identify the research gap on the spatial distribution of livestock in LIVES project and to fill the gap by reviewing different literatures and related works. Besides, we proposed and developed a web-based spatial data management application for the LIVES project that makes use of researchers and academicians to have a ground reference to make further research and improve the internal operations of the organization, raises community satisfaction, and simplifies spatial data management and exchange. In order to conduct and justify this project we reviewed different journal articles and related works. In addition we have discussed with the GIS expert of LIVES project. In the mean time we have also collected livestock shape files from the LIVES project so as to use as an input to the proposed prototype web based application. Through the course of this project we were able to observer and identify that the LIVES project handles and manages their spatial data using ArcGIS Desktop application that lacks to handle and render up-to-date and quality livestock information via the web. We believed that having a web based application is necessary to permit timely livestock information dissemination, easy access, and render up-to-date livestock information to the ix public. Furthermore, it improves the efficiency of spatial data management and provides quality of services through the web.","2015-02-15","2025-10-17 14:17:58","2025-10-21 19:06:43","2025-10-17 14:17:58","","","","","","","","","","","","HiLCoE School of Computer Science and Technology","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476770","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\ATXJEMZC\Solomon and Webshet - 2015 - Spatial data management for livestock distribution in Ethiopia.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476770","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social safety net programs are one of the most common forms of social protection. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the number of social safety net programs has more than tripled since the early 2000s, and today each country in the region operates at least one such program. Evidence is mounting that social safety net programs and social protection more broadly can improve food security, reduce chronic poverty, and build household wealth (assets). Moreover, social safety net programs can improve nutritional outcomes, protect aspirations (people’s ability to visualize and engage in forward-looking activities) during natural disasters, and increase resilience in the face of climate change. Social safety net programs may even prevent local conflicts, increase trust in local governments, and stimulate economic growth by encouraging savings, addressing credit market imperfections, and creating communal assets.

Their effects on poverty and well-being have been widely studied. Yet, there is limited knowledge on how a transfer programme should respond to the dynamics of poverty. This paper contributes to the existing literature on social protection by providing an analysis of the implications of poverty dynamics for the graduation of beneficiaries of Mexico's Oportunidades programme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a framework for a generic graduation condition, to the extent that it can be applied to any other transfer programme with means tests or proxy-means tests. By estimating a Markovian transition model that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity, state dependence, and attrition, and using three rounds of the longitudinal Mexican Family Life Survey, we find that Oportunidades could ""graduate"" only 28.9 and 26.7 per cent of beneficiary households in urban and rural areas, respectively. Our results also show that the ""recertification"" or eligibility assessment of Oportunidades--which takes place every three years--could be optimized by conducting it every 3.5 and 4.1 years in urban and rural areas, respectively.","2014","2025-10-21 16:43:42","2025-10-30 16:36:31","2025-10-21 16:43:42","22","","","","","","Villa (2014)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752202","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\5VHPHXDC\796392285.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752202","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"JPTTEDH6","journalArticle","2025","Papineni Sreelakshmi Gonzalez Martinez, Paula Lorena, Goldstein, Markus","Cash Is Queen : Local Economy Effects of Cash Transfers to Women in West Africa","","","","","","This paper examines the direct and spillover effects of cash transfers paid in a rural and low-income setting. In the short run, an unconditional cash transfer program for ultra-poor households in Northern Nigeria led to a 12 percentage point increase in micro-enterprise formation for program recipients. Moreover, benefits continued to increase in magnitude after program cessation and also extended to nearby non-beneficiary households when compared to counterparts in other villages where no cash transfers were paid. One year after program cessation, beneficiary women increased their enterprise ownership rate by 20 percentage points, while the rate for non-beneficiary women increased by 13 percentage points. Both groups of households enjoyed higher consumption and food security, and shifted away from husband-centered toward joint intrahousehold decision-making. One mechanism for this growth spillover is a boost to aggregate demand for local goods, in part identified by the positive link between the (randomly determined) neighborhood density of cash transfer households and enterprise creation. The increase in local female entrepreneurial activity translates to a partial income multiplier of at least 0.32. Women face restrictive social norms around work in this context and the slack productive resource brought into activity by the cash transfer is female labor, specifically female-led entrepreneurship near the home.","2025","2025-10-21 16:43:41","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-21 16:43:41","","","","","","","Papineni (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121326455","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\MVSPNSBV\IDU-172cd481-ec32-47d0-a1d3-1a3f658485f8.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121326455","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Questions remain if cash transfers can foster investments in productive assets in addition to raising immediate consumption among the very poor, particularly in rural Africa. Further, can asset investment gains be sustained over the medium-term after transfer programme termination? We use quasi-experimental methods combining difference-in-differences with matching on baseline observables to estimate the impacts of a bundled transfer programme on asset levels of beneficiary households 18 months after project completion. The results suggest that small regular cash transfers combined with enhanced saving mechanisms can generate asset accumulation among the extreme poor. In this case, the bundled intervention induces sustained investments in livestock assets. These gains occur among the poorest households and are not driven by gains among less poor beneficiaries. A lasting increase in participation in tontines (rotating saving groups) is also found among beneficiary households, suggesting bundled saving enhancement activities may contribute to observed asset gains.","2020","2025-10-21 16:43:41","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-21 16:43:41","63-89","","1","29","","","Stoeffler (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121329592","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\LH9U7WNF\Stoeffler Quentin Mills, Bradford, Premand, Patrick (2020) Poor Households' Productive Investments of Cash Transfers Quasi-experimental Evidence from Niger.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121329592","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimate the associations between loans from different sources using monthly panel data from Northern Bangladesh. Households borrow from different sources to cope with disasters. The cost of loans, however, may vary by the source of funds. MFI loans, while low in terms of interest cost, usually require a savings deposit, loan or application fee, with a longer trip or waiting time. Hence, households resort to loans from informal sources to deal with crises. We estimate the impulse responses of loans from different sources, which clearly show a hump-shape centring for the months of disasters. Pre-emptive loans are associated only with partially anticipated shocks. Aggregate shocks also limit how much households can borrow from their local peers. Our findings rationalise the roles played by both informal and formal micro-loans in crisis coping in Bangladesh, where the market for microfinance is ubiquitous. The development of the emergency credit market and the introduction of insurance services in rural areas will require the non-price costs of such financial products to be lowered.","2021","2025-10-21 16:43:41","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-21 16:43:41","","","0","73","","","Rabbani (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121329030","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\FF455EMN\Rabbani Atonu Hasan, Md Mehadi (2021) The Role of Borrowing in Crisis Coping among Ultra-poor Households in Rural Bangladesh.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121329030","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) is one of such program. LEAP is a social cash transfer program and its implementation has been under the auspices of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection since 2008. It provides direct cash and health insurance coverage for extremely poor households across the country to alleviate short-term poverty and encourage long-term human capital development. This paper examines the LEAP program in terms of how it has achieved its aim and the opportunities for improvement. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data were obtained from interviews of 110 beneficiaries of the program. The study proposes a conceptual framework that links poverty reduction and social policies to assist researchers analyze pro-poor or social cash transfer program. Findings: The findings show that the program is challenged with administrative bureaucracies, irregular inflow of funds, perceived political interferences, inconsistent implementation strategies and low value of the cash transfer (which results in little or no impact on consumption). However, the data also show that LEAP has positive impacts on nonconsumption spending like children's schooling.

We hypothesized that ultra-poor women participating in the program would have lower domestic violence and depressive symptoms and higher subjective well-being, household economic status, and food security than non-participants. A quasi-experimental design with program and comparison arms and assessments at two times (i.e., baseline and end-line) was used. Analysis of covariance with linear multilevel random-intercept models adjusted for available baseline variables was used to estimate program-comparison differences at end-line for economic status, perceived economy, food insecurity, domestic violence, depressive symptoms, and subjective well-being. We also estimated the benefits attributable to the program for subjective well-being, food insecurity, and domestic violence. Women in the program arm had greater subjective well-being with a decrease in negative affect of life by 33.5% and dissatisfaction with life by 42.5%. The women in the program arm encountered 12% or fewer incidences of domestic violence than did the women in the comparison arm. Food insecurity reduced by an average of 14% due to the program. This poverty-reduction program helped in improving women's access to and control of resources and their social awareness, thus empowering them and promoting economic, social, and psychological well-being. Poverty-reduction programs that acknowledge and address the social complexity of extreme poverty have the potential to effectively reach the ultra-poor who otherwise are often missed by traditional microcredit programs.","2022","2025-10-21 16:43:41","2025-10-30 22:42:06","2025-10-21 16:43:41","843-53","","4","43","","","Jalal (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752214","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\2A94SW32\Jalal Chowdhury S.

In this paper, we assess whether small regular cash transfers strengthen poor households' ability to mitigate the welfare effects of drought shocks. We analyze mechanisms through which cash transfers contribute to resilience, including savings, asset accumulation as well as income smoothing in agriculture and off-farm activities. We combine household survey data collected as part of a randomized control trial in rural Niger with satellite data used to identify exogenous rainfall shocks. The results show that cash transfers increase household consumption by about 10 percent on average. Importantly, this increase is mostly concentrated among households affected by drought shocks, for whom welfare impacts are larger than transfer amounts due to households' enhanced ability to protect earnings in agriculture and off-farm businesses when shocks occur. The results suggest that multi-year cash transfer programs can foster poor households' resilience by facilitating savings and income smoothing.","2022","2025-10-21 16:43:41","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-21 16:43:41","","","0","116","","","Premand (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328023","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\XVLT3B8U\Premand Patrick Stoeffler, Quentin (2022) Cash Transfers, Climatic Shocks and Resilience in the Sahel.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, unlike other graduation programs, this one targeted the urban population and did not offer direct transfers. Its primary purpose was to build capacities among those households who reported wanting to invest their legal monetary compensation as victims in productive projects. A before-after approach was employed to evaluate this program. The main results highlight positive changes in well-being and a reduction in the gap between the current perception of well-being, expectations for two and five years in the future, and positive changes in labor income and informal savings.

The study employs the combined propensity score matching and difference-in-difference technique to obtain robust estimates in examining the effect of the cash transfer program on labor shifts of beneficiaries. Overall, the paper finds that cash transfer programs can have productive impacts and dismisses the assertion that such grants end up making beneficiaries perpetually dependent. The heterogeneous analysis provides evidence that the results are differentiated by age but not by gender. Based on the evidence from this study, we recommend that as LEAP continues to expand and reach more beneficiaries in poor districts, it needs to ensure that the issue of complementarity of poverty reduction programs is a key feature of its design.

Based on absolute well-being (e.g., food security) not dropping, we argue that the treatment effect dissipation is driven primarily by improved living standards for control households rather than losses of the previously accrued benefits for the treatment households.","2024","2025-10-21 16:43:41","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-21 16:43:41","277-94","","2","6","","","Barker (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327221","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\78YJ3NI6\ssrn-4514167.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327221","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"JAVUQPF8","journalArticle","2023","Zheng Geyi","Assessing the Impacts and Spillover Effects of Multifaceted Graduation Programs in a Pastoralist Region","","","","","","Poverty reduction programs inspired by BRAC's graduation approach aim to develop both tangible productive assets and intangible psychosocial assets such as self-confidence and the aspiration for upward mobility. In the broader global context, recent estimates underscore the urgency of poverty alleviation efforts, especially in a post-COVID-19 world. The surge in extreme poverty, coupled with disproportionate setbacks faced by the vulnerable, emphasizes the necessity of targeted interventions like the graduation approach, including fiscal support. The first chapter of this thesis seeks to enhance our understanding of how psychosocial factors operate and shape the impact of graduation programs. After formulating a set of hypotheses about the effects of psychosocial constraints based on a dynamic optimization model that considers the choice between a low-income casual wage-labor occupation and a higher-earning entrepreneurial activity, this paper utilizes a randomized controlled trial of a graduation program implemented in the pastoralist regions of Northern Kenya. Key empirical findings reveal that the estimated highly favorable average treatment effects conceal significant heterogeneity, as beneficiaries who initially experienced severe depressive symptoms gained little from the program. The saturation design of the RCT also enables the identification of substantial spillover effects on the asset accumulation of women who were not enrolled in the graduation program. Spillovers are also shown to positively impact non-beneficiary women's preference for upward economic mobility, providing a plausible explanation for their capital accumulation despite not receiving direct support from the graduation program. The paper extracts implications from these findings for the cost-effective design and implementation of graduation programs. The second chapter delves into the spillover effects of the REAP program through the female kinship network within local communities. In contrast to the previous chapter, which employed a saturation measure on community-level interaction with treated women to assess the impact of treatment intensity on REAP-eligible women, this study investigates spillover effects on control group women whose relatives benefited from the program. The findings reveal increased business assets, savings, and living standards among nontreated women whose relatives were recipients of the REAP program. Importantly, spillover effects are more pronounced for non-head control female respondents compared to female household heads. The study also draws a comparison between spillover effects at the kinship network and community levels. Similar effects are observed in business assets, with unique spillover effects on savings through the kinship network. Overall, this chapter underscores the significance of network structures in poverty alleviation program spillover effects and calls for inclusive strategies tailored to vulnerable groups and their specific needs. The study enhances our comprehension of local network dynamics and provides insights into the success of interventions within developing economies and the intricacies of spillover mechanisms. The third chapter delves into the long-term impacts of the REAP program in pastoralist regions of Northern Kenya, taking into account spillover effects. The research discovers substantial positive effects of the program on women's productive assets and financial savings even four years into the program. However, severe depressive symptoms among beneficiaries lead to varying treatment effect trajectories. With the inclusion of endline data, the study demonstrates continuous treatment effects, revealing an asset accumulation and savings trajectory that peaked at around 30 months into the treatment and then declined by about 20% by 48 months. A positive trajectory for income over 48 months of the program is also observed. Importantly, the spillover impact found at the midline is not sustained at the endline. The distinctive characteristics of the program, including direct initial cash transfers and collaborative business management, introduce complexities in impact estimation, exacerbated by external shocks such as floods, locusts, and COVID-19. Challenges in measuring jointly owned business assets arise from group-based enterprises. These findings provide insights into the intricate dynamics of poverty alleviation interventions in challenging contexts.","2023","2025-10-21 16:43:41","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-21 16:43:41","","","","","","","Zheng (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121326829","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\H9Q3STSL\out.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121326829","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study consists of a cluster-randomized, longitudinal design. After the baseline survey, half of these village clusters were randomly selected to receive the transfer and a follow-up was conducted 17 months later.

After a year's worth of transfers, caregivers in beneficiary households have higher life satisfaction and are more likely to believe in a better future. We examine whether program impacts on consumption, food security, resilience, and hopefulness could explain the increase in SWB but do not find that any of these mechanisms individually mediate our results.","2018","2025-10-21 16:43:42","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-21 16:43:42","331-56","","2","37","","","Kilburn (2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121330396","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\7FB3VYRX\Kilburn Kelly Handa, Sudhanshu, Angeles, Gustavo, Tsoka, Maxton (2018) Paying for Happiness Experimental Results from a Large Cash Transfer Program in Malawi.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121330396","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Familias en Accion Urbano, a conditional cash transfer program implemented at scale in the country of Colombia, uses a means-test cutoff score selection rule that provides exogenous variation in program participation. We reproduce the score assignment rule in a nationally representative living standards household survey that measures multiple dimensions of economic and evaluative wellbeing. Three years into the program, beneficiary households at the margin report greater income, consumption and formal employment participation for both the household head and partner. Household income increased by ten times the amount of the government transfer, likely because of gains in formal employment. Beneficiary households at the margin also report greater overall satisfaction with life, greater happiness and greater satisfaction with food. These results support the hypothesis that among households with basic unmet needs, policies that have a permanent impact on income and consumption may also have a lasting impact on subjective wellbeing and self-sufficiency. Moreover, relatively small subsidies, further offset by additional government tax receipt, may generate substantial benefits to poor families at a reduced cost to taxpayers.","2017","2025-10-21 16:43:42","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-21 16:43:42","","","","","","","Galama (2017)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121330721","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\N365V3BL\w24090.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121330721","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the context in which women would be willing to accept new practices is essential for developing realistic and relevant behaviour change messages. This study sought to fill in this knowledge gap by exploring maternal care practices among women who participated in a grant-based livelihood programme for the ultra poor. This is expected to assist the designing of the health education messages programme in an effort to improve maternal morbidity and survival towards achieving the UN millennium Development Goal 5. Methods - Qualitative method was used to collect data on maternal care practices during pregnancy, delivery, and post-partum period from women in ultra poor households. The sample included both currently pregnant women who have had a previous childbirth, and lactating women, participating in a grant-based livelihood development programme. Rangpur and Kurigram districts in northern Bangladesh were selected for data collection. Results - Women usually considered pregnancy as a normal event unless complications arose, and most of them refrained from seeking antenatal care (ANC) except for confirmation of pregnancy, and no prior preparation for childbirth was taken. Financial constraints, coupled with traditional beliefs and rituals, delayed care-seeking in cases where complications arose. Delivery usually took place on the floor in the squatting posture and the attendants did not always follow antiseptic measures such as washing hands before conducting delivery. Following the birth of the baby, attention was mainly focused on the expulsion of the placenta and various maneuvres were adapted to hasten the process, which were sometimes harmful. There were multiple food-related taboos and restrictions, which decreased the consumption of protein during pregnancy and post-partum period. Women usually failed to go to the healthcare providers for illnesses in the post-partum period. Conclusion - This study shows that cultural beliefs and norms have a strong influence on maternal care practices among the ultra poor households, and override the beneficial economic effects from livelihood support intervention. Some of these practices, often compromised by various taboos and beliefs, may become harmful at times. Health behavior education in this livelihood support program can be carefully tailored to local cultural beliefs to achieve better maternal outcomes.","2011","2025-10-21 16:43:39","2025-10-16 22:43:58","2025-10-21 16:43:39","","","15","11","","","Choudhury (2011)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121319940","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\NCVYA7RN\Choudhury N and Ahmed S M (2011) Maternal care practices among the ultra poor households in rural Bangladesh a qualitative explorato.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121319940","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that the program also improved the nutritional status of women and preschool children. Methods. A nonequivalent control, pre- and posttest quasi-experimental design that was longitudinal at the village level was used to test the hypotheses.

Its aim was to see if, using a model relying on communities to target beneficiaries and deliver payments, the programmes could improve outcomes for the poor the way centrally-run CCT programmes have in other contexts. The programme provided cash payments to poor households, but conditioned payments on complying with certain health and education requirements. Given scarce resources, the Government randomly selected 40 out of 80 eligible villages to receive the pilot programme. Households in participating and comparison villages were broadly comparable at baseline. This report describes the programme and the results of a rigorous, mixed methods impact evaluation. Two and a half years into the programme, participating households were healthier and more educated. Health improvements due to the CCT programme were greatest for the poorest half of households - the poorest of the poor. They experienced a half a day per month reduction in sick days on average, and poor children age 0-4 in particular had a full day per month reduction in stick days. In education, the programme showed clear positive impacts on whether children had ever attended school and on whether they completed Standard 7. Households were also more likely to buy shoes for children, which can promote both health and school attendance. In response to the programme, households also made investments to reduce risk: Participating households were much more likely to finance medical case with insurance and much more likely to purchase health insurance than were their comparison counterparts. The programmes did not significantly affect savings on average, although it did increase non-bank savings amongst the poorest half of households. Participating households also invested in more livestock assets, which they used to create small enterprises. The programme did not, however, have significant impacts on food consumption. On the whole, the results suggest that households focused on reducing risk and on improving their livelihoods rather than principally on increasing consumption.

Pakistan is no exception; in 2008, Pakistan established the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) as an unconditional cash transfer targeted at the poorest of the poor. The primary goal of the BISP program is to provide the poorest households in Pakistan with unconditional transfers in order to improve their consumption and investments in children. To attain this goal, it is believed important that the transfers are provided directly to women to ensure the funds are spent as intended. Beyond changes in consumption and investment, directing these transfers to women can also serve to empower women by increasing household resources under their control. We analyze the impacts of Pakistan’s BISP program on women’s decision-making power within households using data collected between 2011 and 2013 as the program was rolling out. Using fuzzy regression discontinuity methods to statistically identify impacts, the BISP transfer is found to have substantial, positive impacts on some variables measuring women’s decision-making power and empowerment.","2017","2025-10-21 16:43:37","2025-10-16 22:38:53","2025-10-21 16:43:37","","","","","","","Kate (2017)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121307875","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\MRKUWZ5I\113161-WP-P103160-PUBLIC-Social-Protection-Labor-no-1702.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121307875","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This assessment is needed now more than ever as the impending reforms will require having an appropriate system in place for social safety net delivery for the poor and vulnerable. If CT programs are to reach and aid the poor, then ensuring a correlation between poverty and program beneficiaries must be prioritized. Are current beneficiaries of the Sudan CT program, poor households? If targeting is weak, and the answer to the question is no, then scaling up the existing CT program may not achieve its poverty reduction objective. The note proceeds as follows. Section two presents an overview of Sudan’s CT program, including background details, targeting approach used, the number of beneficiaries and the cash transfer amount. Section three shows the extent to which the CT program is benefiting intended poor households based on evidence from the latest household survey data.

Cash transfer programs have had widely documented positive welfare impacts. They often also aim to offer protection against shocks, but their role in fostering resilience has been less studied. This paper assesses whether the beneficiaries of a multiyear government cash transfer program in rural Niger are better able to mitigate the welfare effects of drought shocks. It analyzes mechanisms through which cash transfers contribute to resilience, such as savings facilitation, asset accumulation, or income smoothing in agriculture and off-farm activities. It combines household survey data collected as part of a randomized control trial with satellite data used to identify exogenous rainfall shocks. The results show that cash transfers increase household consumption by about 10 percent on average. Importantly, this increase is mostly concentrated among households affected by drought shocks, for whom welfare impacts are larger than transfer amounts. Cash transfers increase savings. They also help households protect earnings in agriculture and off-farm businesses when shocks occur. Few differences in household durables or livestock are observed. Overall, these findings suggest that cash transfer programs targeting poor households can foster resilience by facilitating savings and income smoothing.","2020","2025-10-21 16:43:37","2025-10-16 22:38:53","2025-10-21 16:43:37","","","","","","","Patrick (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121306844","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\JL9767KP\Do-Cash-Transfers-Foster-Resilience-Evidence-from-Rural-Niger.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121306844","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast with much of the recent literature, the analysis finds little effect of the business development program. While most enterprises remain operative three years after formation, even the highest estimates of effective wage rates suggest returns roughly equivalent to the opportunity cost of time for these households. Trainings on business skills and group transparency did not improve outcomes, although they appear to have exerted a redistributive effect from group elites to rank and file members. Unconditional and unanticipated lump sum cash transfers to randomly selected members of these groups induce all members to invest more in the enterprise, with seemingly little to no return on these marginal investments.

This paper exploits the randomized roll-out of BRAC's ultra-poor graduation program in Bangladesh and panel data covering over 21,000 households over seven years to study the program's effects on interhousehold transfers. The program crowds out informal transfers received by the program's beneficiaries, but this is driven mainly by outside-village transfers. Treated ultra-poor households become more likely to both give and receive transfers to/from wealthier households within their communities; and less likely to receive transfers from their employers. As a result, the reciprocity of their within-village transfers increases. The findings imply that, within rural communities, there is positive assortative matching by socio-economic status. A reduction in poverty enables households to engage more in reciprocal transfer arrangements and lowers the interlinkage of their labor with informal insurance.","2020","2025-10-21 16:43:37","2025-10-30 22:42:15","2025-10-21 16:43:37","","","","","","","Selim (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752199","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\EVTPTFIZ\Poverty-Alleviation-and-Interhousehold-Transfers-Evidence-from-BRACs-Graduation-Program-in-Bangladesh.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121306716; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752199","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction/Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR/TUP), a program implemented by Building Resources Across Communities (BRAC), has been successful in significantly alleviating extreme poverty in rural Bangladesh. We hypothesized that the program also improved participants' subjective wellbeing and nutritional status (i.e., weight-for-height) of children, and decreased food insecurity, domestic violence, and distress. A non-equivalent pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design was used to test the hypotheses. Data were collected from a random sample of 1618 (640 program and 978 control) households across 261 villages under 38 BRAC Area Offices of 3 northern districts of Bangladesh in 2002 and 2005-2006. Linear mixed random-intercept models were used to control for the clustering effects and other potential confounders. Program households in 2006 were significantly better than the control households in women's subjective wellbeing (p<0.001) and weight-for-height of children between ages 24-35 months (p<0.01), and lower in food insecurity (p<0.001) and domestic violence (p<0.01). Reduced food insecurity was a substantial mediator of program effects on other outcomes. The results of this study are highly important as this is a large-scale program already extended to half of the country. Findings will contribute in judging the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of the program, and in garnering support for the expansion of such programs.

Additionally, this study examined the impact of the Academy Program on graduation rates based upon gender. Furthermore, analysis was conducted to determine if a statistically significant relationship existed between graduation and attendance post implementation of the Academy Program. With the Academy Program at this Upstate South Carolina High School, the amount of time spent in mathematics and English classes was doubled for ninth and tenth grade learners. For this study, data were examined two years prior to the implementation of the Academy Program and compared to data four and five years beyond implementation of the program. Graduation rates, ninth and tenth grade retention rates, and ninth and tenth grade student attendance were examined for students targeted to graduate in 2002 and 2003 for the prior implementation years. As the Academy Program was implemented during the 2003-2004 school year, data for post implementation were collected for students coded to graduate in 2007 and 2008. Post implementation data included graduation rates, ninth and tenth grade retention rates, and ninth and tenth grade student attendance. Use of data from 2007 and 2008 allowed for two 4-year cycles of graduation data post implementation of the Academy Program. Results from this study indicated significant differences in student attendance and grade level retention for ninth and tenth grade students after implementation of the program. Results did not indicate a statistically significant difference in graduation rates as a result of the Academy Program. However, a significant difference in graduation rates based on gender was realized after the implementation of the program. Additionally, a statistically significant relationship was found between graduation and attendance; however, the strength of this relationship was small.

We assess TMRI’s impacts at three post-program time points: before the shock (2018), amidst the shock (2021), and after the immediate effects of the shock (2022). We find that TMRI showed protective effects on household food security during and after the pandemic, but program design features “mattered”; positive impacts were only seen in the treatment arm that combined cash transfers with nutrition behavior change communication (Cash+BCC). Other treatment arms – cash only, and food only – showed no significant sustained effects on our household food security measures after the intervention ended, nor did they show protective effects during the pandemic.

The Disability-Inclusive Graduation (DIG) programme targets ultra-poor people with disabilities and/or women living in rural Uganda. The programme is an adaptation of an ultra-poor graduation model that has been shown to be efective in many contexts but not evaluated for people with disabilities. Methods The DIG programme works with project participants over a period of 18 months. Participants receive unconditional cash transfers for 6 months, training, access to savings-and-loans groups, and a capital asset that forms the basis of their new livelihood. The programme is also adapted to address specifc barriers that people with disabilities face. Eligible households are clustered by geographical proximity in order to deliver the intervention. Eligibility is based on household screening to identify the ‘ultra-poor’ based on proxy means testing—both households with and without people with disabilities are included in the programme. Clusters are randomly selected prior to implementation, resulting in 96 intervention and 89 control clusters. The primary outcome of the trial is per-capita household consumption. Before the start of the intervention, a baseline household survey is conducted (November 2020) among project participants and those not ofered the programme, a similar endline survey is conducted with participants with disabilities at the end of programme implementation in July 2022, and a second endline survey for all participants in October 2023. These activities are complemented by a process evaluation to understand DIG programme implementation, mechanisms, and context using complementary qualitative and quantitative methods. Ethical approval for the research has been received from Mildmay Uganda Research Ethics Committee and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Discussion DIG is a promising intervention to evaluate for people with disabilities, adapted to be disability inclusive across programme components through extensive consultations and collaboration, and has proven efcacy at reducing poverty in other marginalised groups. However, evaluating a well-evidenced intervention among a new target group poses ethical considerations.","2024","2025-10-21 16:43:33","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-21 16:43:33","","","","25","","","Kipchumba (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294830","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\D3FTWXX4\Kipchumba Elijah et al.

We use this framework for evaluating the impacts over a six-year period (2002-2008) of an innovative programme, implemented in rural Bangladesh, which has assisted extremely poor households, literally the poorest of the poor. Asset transfers constitute the centrepiece of this multidimensional programme, which also supports training, organisation building, cash supports, microfinance, and so on. The provision of a substantial dose of assets has helped produce very positive results by and large. Impressive income gains have been achieved (and sustained) by the majority of assisted households. But vulnerability to downturns on account of negative events, such as illnesses and house damage, has resulted in asset losses for several assisted households. Better social protection measures will help complete the good work commenced by the asset transfer plan.","2010","2025-10-21 16:43:34","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-21 16:43:34","1-32","","","","","","Krishna (2010)","","","","Brooks World Poverty Institute (BWPI) Working Paper Series","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296009      DOI: No DOI","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\998M7MG6\Krishna Anirudh et al.

CFPR-TUP also reduces women's movement outside the home and control over income, consistent with transferred livestock requiring mainte- nance at home.

This correlation often instigates an expectation that increasing income of the poor households will lead to greater human capital accumulation. This paper exploits randomized roll-out of a large-scale livelihood development programme for the ultra-poor in Bangladesh to measure the effect of asset transfer and livelihood supports on children's schooling. We find limited impact on enrolment although this programme has been extremely successful in transforming the economic lives of the ultra-poor and causing substantial increases in their income and productive assets. The beneficiary households are also found to have increased their expenditures on education. This increase in educational investment, however, has not affected educational attainment during the evaluation period. We also find that the programme increased the extent of child labour immediately after asset transfers. The level of this impact on children's work declines two years after the interventions ended. The increases in child labour are concentrated in activities related to livestock rearing, which is the primary type of asset transferred in this programme. However, we do not find evidence indicating a trade-off between children's enrolment and work. The evidence suggests that asset transfer programmes can be more effective by including additional components focusing on improvement in educational outcomes instead of relying primarily on spillover effects through income gain.","2015","2025-10-21 16:43:33","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-21 16:43:33","1755-1978","","2","26","","","Sulaiman (2015)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295946","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\TE2QP7KD\Sulaiman Munshi (2015) Does Wealth Increase Affect School Enrolment In Ultra-Poor Households Evidence From An Experiment I.pdf","","Access To Education; School Enrolment; Asset Transfer; Programme Evaluation; Livelihood Development","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295946","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence From BRAC's Challenging The Frontiers Of Poverty Reduction—Targeting The Ultra Poor Program In Bangladesh","","","","","https://dspace.bracu.ac.bd:8443/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10361/15919/ifpridp01317.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y","Growing evidence shows that the distribution of individuals' ownership and control of assets within a household can have important implications for women's empowerment and children's well-being. Interventions that target assets to specific individuals can shift these intrahousehold dynamics, yet little evidence exists from rigorous evaluations. We study BRAC's Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction—Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) program in Bangladesh, which targets asset transfer (primarily livestock) and training to rural women in poor households. Previous research has shown large, significant positive program impacts at the household level. In this paper, we examine intrahousehold impacts using mixed methods. We focus on the Specially Targeted Ultra-Poor (STUP) component of the program, which targets households selected following a randomized controlled trial design. Adding a new round of data collection with quantitative sex-disaggregated information and qualitative exploration, we exploit the randomized design to assess intrahousehold impacts of STUP. Our analysis confirms that the program significantly increases household ownership of various assets but has complex effects on the targeted women. Quantitative estimates show increases in women's sole and joint ownership of or control over transferred assets such as livestock, but a much greater increase in men's sole ownership over nearly all other assets (including agricultural and nonagricultural productive assets, land, and consumer durables). These findings suggest that while the transferred assets tend to remain with women, new investments from mobilized resources are controlled by men. Moreover, the program reduces women's mobility outside the home and their control over income, consistent with the transferred asset's requiring maintenance at home. Qualitative findings are consistent with these quantitative results, but women's contribution to their households is perceived as increasing their confidence and social capital, which they themselves value. Therefore, while provision of assets and training to women has ambiguous effects on women's empowerment in terms of tangible assets and decisionmaking, women take intangibles into account and largely perceive positive (though still mixed) effects. The analysis shows that asset transfer targeted to women can increase women's ownership of and control over the transferred asset itself but may not necessarily increase women's intrahousehold bargaining position. Moreover, it reveals that outcomes valued by individuals may not always be tangible, highlighting the complexity of assessing whether interventions improve women's empowerment.","2013","2025-10-21 16:43:33","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-21 16:43:33","","","","","","","Das (2013)","","","","International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) Discussion Paper Series","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295804      DOI: No DOI","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\IV5PTCRV\Das Narayan et al.

There may be scope for designing safety net programs that can actually contribute to human development through improvements in education, health, and nutrition of the poor. Bangladesh’s progress in economic growth has contributed to a reduction in the headcount poverty rate from 40 percent in 2005 to 31.5 percent in 2010, according to the official poverty estimates (BBS 2011). This progress is of little comfort, however, since the overall incidence of poverty persists at a high level, leaving about 28 million people unable to afford an adequate diet. Chronically underfed and highly vulnerable, this segment of the population remains largely without assets (other than its own labor power) to cushion “lean-season” hunger or the debilitating shock of illness, flooding, and other unexpected events.

Using data from multiple waves of a Randomized Controlled Trial, this thesis estimates the effect of BRAC’s “Targeting the Ultra-Poor” - an anti-poverty program involving asset and credit transfers that also aims to provide multidimensional support to the targeted ultra-poor households. The program offers two intervention packages: (1) Specially Targeted Ultra-poor (STUP) package, a grant-based support package that transfers asset as a grant, and (2) Other Targeted Ultra-poor (OTUP) package, a credit plus approach that provides a soft loan along with other supports. The focuses of my studies are on both support packages. Since the program is targeted to the main female of the household, it could potentially affect the economic and behavioural outcomes for both the recipients and their children. These impacts may be in the form of changes in (i) children’s time allocation to education and income-generating activities, (ii) own preferences that matter for economic decision-making, and (iii) the control of intrahousehold decision-making, self-esteem and self-confidence. This thesis explores these three domains. The first study investigates the short and long-run impact of this program onthe time allocation between study and work among the children of program beneficiaries. Despite randomization, we estimate the effects of the intervention using difference-in-difference after controlling for respondent’s socio-demographic characteristics. We find that the likelihood of a child adopting self-employment increases significantly across all waves because of asset transfer. However, there are significant temporal and gender differences in the effects on their study time: the effect is negative in the short run but positive in the long run for the boys, but not significantly so for the girls. Our findings corroborate the Beckerian model of time allocation: in the short run, asset transfer expands the earning opportunities inducing substitution of study time for work, especially among the boys. The second study explores whether the effect of the anti-poverty programextends beyond poverty reduction and improve economic decision-making. It examines the program impact on time preference and risk attitude in the financial domain and provides causal evidence of how an increase in wealth affects the intertemporal choice and risk aversion. This paper presents robust evidence that the program beneficiaries exhibit more patience, and risk tolerance than the nonbeneficiaries. These are consistent across various tools of elicitation and measures of time and risk preferences. These outcomes demonstrate an increase in income and wealth decrease absolute risk aversion, while increase risk tolerance, thus rejecting the constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) preference. In terms of policy implications, these findings provide empirical evidence that interventions designed to improve socio-economic conditions of the participants lead to more patience and more willingness to take risks, this is a significant, extra outcome of such interventions, with far-reaching consequences for their upcoming financial outcomes. The third study examines whether the program enhances the women’s abilityto influence intra-household decision-making, communal cohesion, awareness for women’s rights both within and outside of the household, competitiveness and selfconfidence – the much-needed behavioural traits among economically disenfranchised rural Bangladeshi women. Our empirical results show positively significant effects on enhancing sole and joint decision-making capabilities, social inclusion, and awareness about social and legal issues while domestic violence against women is likely to decrease after the intervention. These results provide some strong theoretical and empirical insights. From a policy point of view, the findings show that a well-targeted asset and credit transfer program may confer behavioural and personal benefits that accrue over and beyond what is measured in terms of income and consumption","2021","2025-10-21 16:43:33","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-21 16:43:33","","","","","","","Ara (2021)","","","","Not applicable","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295161","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\3QU397WS\Jinnat_Ara_Thesis.pdf","","Bangladesh; Employment; Multinomial Logit; Impact Evaluation; awareness; Decision-making; Domestic Violence; Women’s empowerment; Randomized controlled trials (RCT); risk aversion; Social inclusion; BRAC; Competitiveness; Child Labour; Asset Transfer; Constant absolute risk aversion; Count variables; Credit plus approach; Customized credit transfer; Diminishing absolute risk aversion; Discount rates; Financial investment; Future bias; Generalized linear regression; Healthcare Expenditure; Hurdle model; Impatience; Negative binomial; Present bias; Risk attitudes; Self-work; Skilled work; Social and legal issues; Time consistency; Time preference; Unskilled work","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295161","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, women’s access to economic resources does not always translate into improved bargaining power, and effects of economic strengthening interventions may vary across different decision-making domains. There is little robust evidence, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, showing the effect of improved access to economic resources on specific domains of decision-making within a family and very little is known about variation in this effect between monogamous and polygynous families. Furthermore, very few assessments explicitly examine specific pathways from participation in economic strengthening interventions to improved decision-making power in the household for women. Our study aims to address these gaps by examining—in the context of a randomized controlled trial administered in rural Burkina Faso—the effect of an economic strengthening intervention on specific domains of women’s decision-making power and how it relates to monogamous/polygynous family structures and challenges to intra-household gender roles and responsibilities. Furthermore, we examine a specific pathway to better understand whether increased access to economic resources from this intervention translates into improved decision-making power for women. We use repeated-measures data collected from 360 adult female caregivers in the 3-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted among households living in abject poverty in Burkina Faso. We ran multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models to examine the effect of the intervention on different domains of women’s involvement into household-level decision-making and variation of this effect by family structure (i.e. polygamous vs. monogamous families). We fit a structural equation model to examine whether access to assets mediates the effect of the intervention on different domains of women’s involvement into household-level decision-making. We found that economic empowerment intervention increased women’s involvement in making decisions about their children’s well-being, but had no effect on women’s say in making decisions about general household economy. We found most effects to be stronger in the treatment arm that received economic strengthening combined with family coaching offered to the whole household and directly targeting normative beliefs related to child wellbeing and gender norms. We also found no evidence that increased access to assets mediates the effect of intervention on improving women’s decision-making power in different domains. Our findings suggest that to improve decision-making power for women in their household it is important to address structural gender inequalities and gender norms rooted in patriarchy, alongside the efforts to economically empower women.","2021","2025-10-30 20:05:42","2025-10-22 19:42:14","2025-10-30 20:05:42","105159-05159","","","137","","","Karimli (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058353","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\97Y9BNWX\Karimli Leyla et al.

Evidence from Rural Ethiopia","","","","","https://cgspace.cgiar.org/items/da46ba17-bfe9-458f-b81c-a09754e60761","We study the role of a multifaceted ultra-poor graduation program in protecting household wellbeing and women’s welfare from the effects of localized droughts in Ethiopia. We use data from a large experimental trial of an integrated livelihood and nutrition intervention that supplemented the consumption support provided by Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), conducted within a sample in which all households were beneficiaries of the PSNP. We match three rounds of household survey data to detailed satellite weather data to identify community-level exposure to droughts. We then exploit random assignment to the graduation program to evaluate whether exposed households show heterogeneous effects of drought on household food security and livestock holdings, women’s diets and nutritional status, and prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV). We find that droughts have substantial negative effects on these outcomes, but the intervention serves to consistently moderate these effects, and for some outcomes (particularly diets and nutrition and IPV), the intervention fully protects households from any adverse drought affects. A further analysis exploits variation across treatment arms that received different program elements and suggests that the primary mechanism is enhanced household savings.","2023","2025-10-21 16:43:33","2025-10-16 09:32:59","2025-10-21 16:43:33","","","","","","","Hirvonen (2023)","","","","International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) Discussion Paper Series","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058360      DOI: 10.2499/p15738coll2.137000","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\6WI8RX6S\121058360.pdf","","Climate change; Resilience; Social Safety Nets; Weather shocks; graduation model programs","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058360","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this paper is to better understand how psychosocial factors operate and shape the impact of graduation programs. After deriving a set of hypotheses about the impacts of psychosocial constraints from a dynamic optimization model of the choice between a low income, casual wage-labor occupation and a higher earning entrepreneurial activity, this paper exploits a randomized controlled trial of a graduation program implemented in the pastoralist regions of Northern Kenya. Key empirical findings include that the estimated highly favorable average treatment effects disguise substantial heterogeneity, with beneficiaries who began with severe depressive symptoms gaining little from the program. The RCT's saturation design also allows us to identify substantial spillover effects onto the asset accumulation of women who were not enrolled in the graduation program. Spillovers are also estimated to positively affect non-beneficiary women's preference for upward economic mobility, providing a plausible explanation for their accumulation of capital despite no direct support from the graduation program. The paper draws out the implications of these findings for the cost-effective design and implementation of graduation programs.&nbsp;","2023","2025-10-21 16:43:33","2025-10-16 09:32:59","2025-10-21 16:43:33","","","","","","","Zheng (2023)","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058366      DOI: No DOI","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\MC5AT5BE\w31611.pdf","","Women; KENYA; Randomized Control Trial; REAP","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058366","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To meet the increasing food demand of the growing population there is a need to intensify production practices. In this regard, improved potato varieties production plays a great role in improving the household’s food security, food consumption, and food diversity, and there-by contributing to nutrition security. This study analyzes the probability and use intensity of improved potato varieties adoption and, the effect of adoption on households’ nutrition security. The data was collected in 2018 at Emba Alaje woreda from a survey of 370 households (185 improved potato variety growers and 185 non-growers). Sampling weights were used to account the proportion of the sample compared to the whole population. Tobit model was used to analyze the factors affecting the probability and use intensity of improved potato varieties adoption. Both propensity score matching (PSM) and endogenous switching regression model (ESRM) were used to analyze the impacts of improved potato varieties on households’ nutrition using Food security scale, Food consumption score and Household dietary diversity score proxy variables. To control the possible selection problem invers mill’s ratio was included in the second stage equations. Size of own land, distance of the nearest plot, access to extension services, the existence of neighbor adopter, perception on the improved potato varieties’ maturity period and tuber yield potential were found as the main factors of adoption probability and use intensity of improved potato varieties. The PSM result indicated that, adoption of improved potato varieties increases the average food security scale, food consumption score and the dietary diversity score by 1.79, 6.6 and 0.8 points, respectively. Similarly, the ESRM result confirmed that, improved potato varieties adoption increases the average food security scale, food consumption and dietary diversity score by 2, 6.1 and 1.4 points, respectively. Thus, to improve the nutritional status of the farming households, government should give due emphasis for potato production and the extension service need to be strengthen.","2019-06-30","2025-10-17 14:03:07","2025-10-21 19:05:21","2025-10-17 14:03:07","","","","","","","Adoption of improved potato varieties and its impact on household nutrition","","","","","Bahir Dar University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476459","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\64IMPCC5\Ebrahim - 2019 - Adoption of improved potato varieties and its impact on household nutrition Evidence from Emba Alaj.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476459","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously in the Derge Regime, another resettlement program has been implemented in 1985 and voluntary settlers were in-migrating even before that. Extension service is mandated to assist them in order to improve the production and productivity of the farmers, enabling them to achieve food security and income generation. This study is aimed at assessing the new and previous settler farmers’ access to and utilization of agricultural information from the extension service and as well as to identify the influencing factors. A two stage random sampling technique was employed and in the first stage of sampling, three PAs were selected purposively and the respondents were stratified into new and previous settler categories. In the second stage, probability proportional to size sampling technique was applied to each stratum. Finally, 160 sample respondents were selected using simple random sampling technique and interviewed using pre-tested structured interview schedule. Fifteen percent of respondents were female headed households. Both primary and secondary data were collected and analyzed to understand various aspects of access and utilization of agricultural information of farmers. Qualitative data were used to supplement quantitative data. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis and Tobit model. Except from seasonal extension orientation and mass media, in all cases there was significant difference between new and previous settlers’ access to and utilization of agricultural information. In all extension methods, there were highly significant differences between male and female headed households in obtaining agricultural information, in the favor of males. The female headed respondents utilized the obtained information with comparable to male headed households. The agricultural information and support for utilization provided by the extension service were biased towards the previous settlers and males, and consequently the new settler farmers’ and female headed households agricultural information access and utilization was very limited. The survey finding reveals that the current extension service has limited responsiveness, gender sensitivity and poor potential of addressing farmers’ need. In the absence of responsive extension service that understands and addresses interests of various groups of farmers, the purpose of resettlement program would not be fulfilled. Result of the econometric model indicated that, settlement category, education level, settlement orientation, innovation proneness, production motivation, age of household head, frequency of market visiting and credit access had influence on the access to and utilization of agricultural information. The overall finding of the study underlined the importance of well organized agricultural information provision and supporting utilization of information through the delivery of credit and technologies based on the farmers’ problem and need. Institutionalized and genuine resettlement program information provision in the highland also required. Therefore, policy and development interventions should give emphasis to improvement of such institutional support system so as to enhance the production and productivity of agriculture and to achieve the desired poverty reduction strategy in the resettlement program.","2008-04-15","2025-10-17 14:09:45","2025-10-21 19:05:20","2025-10-17 14:09:45","","","","","","","Access and utilization of agricultural information by resettler farming households","","","","","Haramaya University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476456","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\AVVMV8PQ\Tadesse - 2008 - Access and utilization of agricultural information by resettler farming households the case of Mete.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476456","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2006, CGAP and the Ford Foundation teamed up to determine whether BRAC’s Ultra-Poor Graduation Approach could be adapted successfully outside Bangladesh. They identified ten partners in eight countries around the world and, with much foresight, invested in an evaluation strategy that would provide an impressive body of evidence once these programs had completed nearly a decade later. Eight of the sites were evaluated with randomized evaluations which were complemented with rigorous qualitative research. Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) conducted seven of the randomized evaluations. We pooled the data from six of the randomized evaluations and published the results in Science (Banerjee et al. 2015). The results showed positive impacts on every outcome we looked at, including income and revenues, total per-capita consumption, assets, food security, women’s empowerment, physical health, financial inclusion, mental health, total time spent working, and political involvement. Today the World Bank's Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI) counts 219 active economic inclusion programs implemented by governments and NGOs across 75 countries, and extending to new populations including the urban poor and refugees. IPA has developed a Research Agenda for the Next Wave of Graduation Programs that focuses on unpacking the pieces of the multidimensional approach, optimizing component levels, and experimenting with variations to improve cost-effectiveness and enable scale.","2019","2025-10-16 22:43:31","2025-10-21 19:05:19","2025-10-16 22:43:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476453","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\BBBIJC5Y\research-agenda-next-wave-graduation-programs.html","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476453","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the progress made, the level of hunger in the world remains “serious,” with 870 million people going hungry, according to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organiza-tion of the United Nations. Across regions and countries, GHI scores vary considerably. South Asia and Africa south of the Sahara are home to the highest GHI scores. South Asia significantly lowered its GHI score between 1990 and 1995, mainly thanks to a large decline in underweight in children, but was not able to maintain its fast progress. Social inequality and the low nutritional, educational, and social status of women continue to contrib-ute to the high prevalence of underweight in children under five. Africa south of the Sahara did not advance as much as South Asia in the 1990s. Since the turn of the millennium, however, Africa south of the Sahara has shown real progress, and its GHI score is now lower than South Asia’s. More political stability in countries earlier affect-ed by civil wars in the 1990s and 2000s meant economic growth could resume. Advances in the fight against HIV and AIDS, a decrease in the prevalence of malaria, and higher immunization rates contributed to a reduction in child mortality. Since 1990, 23 countries made significant progress, reducing their GHI scores by 50 percent or more. Twenty-seven countries moved out of the “extremely alarming” and “alarming” categories. In terms of absolute progress, the top ten countries in terms of improvements in GHI scores since 1990 were Angola, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Niger, Rwanda, Thailand, and Vietnam.","2013-10-14","2025-10-17 14:28:36","2025-10-21 19:05:18","2025-10-17 14:28:36","","","","","","","2013 Global hunger index","","","","","International Food Policy Research Institute","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476447  DOI: 10.2499/9780896299511","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\VRT8IY6P\von Grebmer et al. - 2013 - 2013 Global hunger index The challenge of hunger Building resilience to achieve food and nutrition.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476447","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These effects can be particularly salient for women, who often have less resources than male family members even within poor households (Fruttero et al. 2023, van Daalen et al. 2020), and who may face increased vulnerability to violence (Abiona and Koppensteiner 2018, Díaz and Saldarriaga 2023, Epstein et al. 2020).

We find that three years post-baseline, the intervention inclusive of the transfer leads to some increases in assets, savings, and cash income from livestock, though there is no shift in consumption or household food security; these effects are consistent regardless of the modality of the transfer (cash versus poultry).

One possible way of improving the cost-effectiveness of the model is to analyse the treatment effect heterogeneity and identify the participants who do not gain much from the programme and better customise the interventions to their needs. Applying recently developed machine learning methods on a large-scale RCT dataset from Bangladesh, we identify and characterise the program participants who benefit and who do not. We find significant variation in impact on assets where the top quintile gainers experience asset growth of 337% while asset growth is only 189% for the bottom quintile. Heterogeneity in impact on household expenditures is found to be present but of lower magnitude than that of assets. Importantly, the machine learning techniques we apply reveal contrasts in characteristics of beneficiaries who made the most in assets vs. consumption. The most benefitted households in per-capita wealth outcome were relatively older, were more dependent on wage income, had less involvement in self-employment activities, and had lower participation in household decision-making at baseline. In contrast, the top quintile gainers of household expenditure are younger, earn less from wages, depend more on self-employment income, and have higher participation in household decision-making. The results identify beneficiary characteristics that can be used in targeting households either to maximise impact on the desired dimension and/or to customise interventions for balancing the asset and consumption trade-off.","2024","2025-10-17 14:20:11","2025-10-21 16:46:49","2025-10-21 16:43:41","282-301","","2","16","","","Chowdhury (2024)","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327105","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\IZSWPHB2\Chowdhury Reajul Alam, Ceballos-Sierra, Federico, Sulaiman, Munshi - 2024 - Grow the Pie, or Have It Using Machine Learning to Impact Heterogeneity in the Ultra-Poor Graduatio.pdf; C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\B7DBPHFE\Grow+the+pie+or+have+it+Using+machine+learning+to+impact+heterogeneity+in+the+Ultra-poor+graduation+model.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implemented by the Ministry of Social Solidarity, the program aims to graduate beneficiaries of the national cash transfer program, the Takaful & Karama Program (TKP), to economic self-reliance by enabling them to engage in wage employment or sustainable economic enterprises. The 2021 World Bank Economic Inclusion report (Andrews et al. 2021) highlights a recent increase globally in such graduation or economic inclusion programs, which now reaches around 92 million beneficiaries from 20 million households across more than 75 countries. This rapid growth has necessitated an increasing demand for evidence on best practices in graduation program implementation. The newly designed Forsa program is based on the graduation approach, but with innovations drawing from theories of behavioral economics as well as creating a network of active youth volunteers for economic empowerment to reduce costs compared to the standard BRAC-inspired model. Forsa also expands the graduation model to include the option of wage-employment, rather than only focusing on self-employment. Evidence on the impact of job training programs linked to wage employment on both job retention and future earnings is mixed (McKenzie 2017), although most such programs do not include cash assistance. This impact evaluation of the Forsa program in Egypt is intended to contribute to the global evidence on effective graduation program design as well as provide immediate policy-relevant guidance for the Ministry of Social Solidarity. The impact evaluation will measure the degree to which Forsa is successful at increasing household consumption and will investigate which participant groups and program features demonstrate the greatest improvements in household welfare and economic activity.","2022","2025-10-17 13:40:16","2025-10-30 22:42:31","2025-10-21 16:43:44","","","","","","","Gilligan (2022)","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752176","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\DMSW4V2T\Gilligan et al. - 2022 - Impact evaluation report Egypt’s Forsa graduation program.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121378217; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752176","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, extremely poor households received a one-time livelihood grant on an experimental basis, as cash transfers or in-kind poultry grants, at a value much smaller than lump sum transfers in other graduation model programs in recent literature. The experiment compared a core nutrition model of nutrition information and sanitation and hygiene activities to an enhanced model that added more intensive nutrition messaging, supplementary feeding of malnourished children, mental health services, and a male engagement activity. Results show that interaction with health care workers and participation in community health activities increased significantly under the enhanced nutrition model, as did maternal nutritional knowledge. Nevertheless, neither nutrition model led to significant improvements in child dietary diversity or anthropometric outcomes on average.

A grants-based integrated intervention was developed (with health inputs to mitigate the income-erosion effect of illness) to examine whether such a targeted intervention could change the health-seeking behaviour of the ultra-poor towards greater use of health services and ""formal allopathic"" providers during illness, besides improving their poverty status and capacity for health expenditure. The study was carried out in three northern districts of Bangladesh with high density of ultra poor households, using a pre-test/post-test control group design. A pre-intervention baseline (2189 interventions and 2134 controls) survey was undertaken in 2002 followed by an intervention (of 18 months duration) and a post-intervention follow-up survey of the same households in 2004. Structured interviews were conducted to elicit information on health-seeking behaviour of household members. Findings reveal an overall change in health-seeking behaviour in the study population, but the intervention reduced self-care by 7 percentage units and increased formal allopathic care by 9 percentage units. The intervention increased the proportion of non-deficit households by 43 percentage units, as well as the capacity to spend more than Tk. 25 for treatment of illness during the reference period by 11 percentage units. Higher health expenditure and time (pre- to -post-intervention period) was associated with increased use of health care from formal allopathic providers. However, gender differences in health-seeking and health-expenditure disfavouring women were also noted. The programmatic implications of these findings are discussed in the context of improving the ability of health systems to reach the ultra poor.","2006","2025-10-21 16:43:39","2025-10-30 22:42:02","2025-10-21 16:43:39","2899-2911","","11","63","","","Ahmed (2006)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752229","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\4RMXW6L5\Ahmed S M et al.

Results of several studies have shown that the extreme poor, or the ultra-poor, often are unable to benefit from traditional microcredit programmes and can, as a result of taking a loan they cannot repay, sink deeper into economic and social poverty. This case study describes an intervention directed at enabling the ultra-poor rural populations to pull themselves out of poverty. The intervention integrates multiple components, including asset grants for income generation, skills training, a time-bound monthly stipend for subsistence, social development and mobilization of local elite, and health support. Results of an evaluation showed that, after 18 months, the programme positively impacted livelihood, economic, social and health status to the extent that 63% of households (n=5,000) maintained asset growth and joined (or intended to join) a regular microcredit programme. Impacts included improved income, improved food security, and improved health knowledge and behaviour. Applying a social exclusion framework to the intervention helps identify the different dynamic forces that can exclude or include the ultrapoor in Bangladesh in development interventions such as microcredit.","2009","2025-10-21 16:43:39","2025-10-21 16:45:17","2025-10-21 16:43:39","528-535","","4","27","","","Ahmed (2009)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121321022","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\W3TFGBUB\Ahmed S M and Johnston H B (2009) Capability development among the ultra-poor in Bangladesh a case study.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121321022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These results are consistent with the idea that better access to markets disperses environmental harm and the full effects of treatment can only be observed where poor infrastructure localizes them.","2010","2025-10-21 16:43:39","2025-10-30 16:36:43","2025-10-21 16:43:39","47-pp","","549","","","","Alix-Garcia (2010)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752242","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\EKCUDD4X\rest_a_00349.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752242","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While poverty alleviation interventions show promise for improving health outcomes, evidence specifically for people with disabilities remains limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a disability-inclusive graduation (DIG) programme on health outcomes among ultra-poor people with disabilities in Uganda. Methods: We conducted a two-arm, parallel cluster-randomized controlled trial in four districts of Northern Uganda. Clusters were randomly assigned to either the DIG intervention (96 clusters) or control group (89 clusters). This analysis focused on households with people with disabilities, as identified by the Washington Group Short Set questions and verified by BRAC programme managers. Households in treatment clusters received up to 18 months DIG intervention between December 2020 and June 2022, combining asset transfers, cash support, skills training, financial inclusion activities, and disability-specific services including rehabilitation and assistive devices. The primary outcome was experience of illness/injury in the past 3 months, assessed at both first follow-up (immediately post-intervention) and second follow-up (about 16 months post-intervention), with secondary outcomes including unmet health needs, mental health status, unmet assistive product needs, and healthcare expenditure. Effects were estimated using linear mixed-effects regression or generalized estimating equations, reporting minimally-adjusted and fully-adjusted mean differences (FAMD) or odds ratios (FAOR) with 95% CIs. The trial was registered with RIDIE (RIDIE-STUDY-ID-626008898983a) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN-78592382). Findings: At baseline, 691 participants (370 intervention, 321 control) were included. The DIG intervention did not significantly impact overall illness/injury prevalence at either first follow-up (41.18% vs 45.86%, FAOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58-1.22) or second follow-up (55.65% vs 53.98%, FAOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74-1.56). However, the intervention demonstrated a progressively strengthening effect on reducing unmet health needs, from marginal improvement immediately post-intervention (FAOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31-1.02, p = 0.06) to significant reduction at 16 months post-intervention (FAOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.22-0.71, p = 0.002). Notably, the intervention produced temporal potential shifts in disease patterns, with malaria showing contrasting trends between follow-up periods. Sex-differentiated effects emerged by second follow-up, with females in the intervention group experiencing fewer injuries (FAOR for interaction 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.74, p = 0.02) but more pain-related conditions compared to males (FAOR for interaction 2.43, 95% CI 1.05-5.59, p = 0.04), though these subgroup findings require replication in future studies. No significant differences were observed in mental health outcomes or health expenditure. Interpretation: This first randomized evaluation of a disability-inclusive graduation programme demonstrates that while economic empowerment alone may not reduce overall illness prevalence among people with disabilities, it can progressively improve healthcare access over time. The temporal evolution of effects and emerging sex-differentiated impacts highlight the need for sustained support and gender-sensitive approaches in future disability-inclusive poverty reduction programmes, with additional health-specific components to achieve broader improvements in health outcomes.","2025","2025-10-21 16:43:43","2025-10-21 16:45:16","2025-10-21 16:43:43","","","","85","","","Chen (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121340926","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\SFJKRT78\Chen Shanquan Banks, Lena Morgon, Kipchumba, Elijah, Davey, Calu (2025) Evaluation of health impacts of a disability-inclusive graduation programme among ultra-poor people.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121340926","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While some successfully ensure food security and survival for the poorest, few have moved large numbers of people sustainably out of poverty and into productive livelihood opportunities. Purpose: This article aims to understand better the challenges to sustainable graduation out of poverty, and why graduation has been so difficult to achieve in many social protection programmes. Approach and Methods: We define graduation and identify primary objectives related to food security and consumption and secondary objectives for asset accumulation. We then apply this thinking to the case of the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia, drawing on evaluation spanning the first 10 years of the programme. Findings: The programme has been successful on some fronts--such as saving lives, reducing distress sales and providing community-level services--while on others, such as household asset building and livestock accumulation, it has failed to deliver. Given this, we ask why the programme has underperformed in building household assets, and further, why the PSNP programme proceeded to prematurely graduate so many households despite the lack of evidence on livelihood strengthening. It seems that the PSNP was unable to lift most households out of poverty, owing to lack of capacity to design and implement measures to raise incomes and to lack of opportunities to do so. Many households, however, were graduated out of PSNP, apparently because field staff had quotas to fulfil, whether or not the households had progressed out of poverty. Policy implications: The PSNP shows how a programme can succeed in its primary objective of alleviating deep poverty and preventing people from becoming destitute. But it also shows that to reach the more ambitious target of graduating households out of poverty, more funds and administrative capacity are needed to generate additional household economic activity. Investments in complementary rural services are needed as well.","2021","2025-10-21 16:43:41","2025-10-21 16:45:14","2025-10-21 16:43:41","511-31","","4","39","","","Sabates-Wheeler (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328299","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\QRW4GS47\Sabates-Wheeler Rachel Lind, Jeremy, Hoddinott, John, Taye, Mulugeta Tefe (2021) Graduation after 10 Years of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme Surviving but Still Not Thr.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328299","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Special attention is warranted on the ultra-poor population of the country. An 18 month-long economic development program, designed based on an ultra-poor graduation approach, was implemented to alleviate poverty and improve child nutrition in rural Bangladesh. Objective The study examined the impact of livelihood components of an economic development program on outcomes related to poultry/crop production, consumption, and income generation among the ultra-poor throughout quarterly follow-ups. Methods This secondary data analysis used the monitoring records of 2960 poor or ultra-poor households receiving assets of (1) 9-26 ducks (n = 2125), (2) 11 chickens (n = 872), and/or (3) vegetable seeds (n = 2407). Data measuring the production of assets, income generation, and consumption of assets were collected quarterly throughout 2019. To examine a one-year-long trend in participation, production, income generation, and consumption of assets, a one-way analysis of variance was conducted across the follow-ups. Additional analyses of annual income and consumption comparing duck and chicken groups were performed using linear regression models. Results The number of poultry assets per household decreased between the April- June and July-Sep follow-ups, while consumption of poultry and vegetable assets increased during the monsoon season (p < 0.001 for all). The vegetable production reflected seasonal fluctuations, where the lowest production and income were reported during the monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. We observed increasing voluntary adoption of poultry farming among the non-asset group for both duck and chicken over the follow-ups (p < 0.001 for all). The households provided with duck assets gained a greater mean annual income compared to the households provided with chicken assets. Conclusions Our findings highlight opportunities for strengthening the ultra-poor graduation approach on livelihood promotion in future scale-up in rural Bangladesh.","2022","2025-10-21 16:43:43","2025-10-30 22:42:27","2025-10-21 16:43:43","","","2031595","15","","","Volpenhein (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752178","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\B58IZSGK\Volpenhein Paige Kim, Hee Sun, Kim, Yunjeong, Hussein, Md Iqbal, Bi (2022) Impact of a livelihood promotion program on income generation and food consumption among ultra-poor.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121351060; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752178","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large body of evidence across numerous settings shows that cash and food transfer programs are highly effective in doing so. However, there is growing interest in understanding the extent to which such programs can help households stay out of poverty in the longer term, specifically after transfers end. We bring new evidence to this question, re-interviewing Bangladeshi households that participated in a well-implemented randomized social protection intervention four years after it ended. We find that combining transfers, either cash or food, with behavior change communication activities sustainably reduced poverty. Cash transfers alone had sustainable effects, but these were context-specific.

It is widely accepted that most common governmental and non-governmental development interventions in Bangladesh fail to include the ultra poor. Microfinance, even if targeted towards the ultra poor, cannot bring about sustainable growth for the poorest of the poor (Matin 2002, Morduch 1999). This is because the ultra poor are crippled by multiple evils – malnutrition, illiteracy, lack of access to basic health services, limited access to community support – that keep them chronically poor (Sen and Hulme 2004). Transfer payments help the poor over the short term, but do not by themselves trigger sustainable income growth for the ultra poor.

We estimate the short run effects of this policy change on the income, employment, and poverty rate of farmworkers, using individual-level panel data from the Quarterly Labour Force Surveys (QLFS). Before the implementation date, 90 per cent of farmworkers were paid below the new minimum wage level. We find that the wage gain of farmworkers is strongly quadratically related to pre-implementation wages, suggesting lower compliance as the gap between the minimum and the pre implementation wage increases. We estimate that farmworkers received a median wage increase of 9 per cent as a result of the policy, and we find no evidence of job losses. Overall, farmworkers were 7 per cent less likely to have household income per person below the poverty line. One possible explanation for these outcomes is that endogenous compliance may mitigate against unemployment effects. While the minimum wage literature is large, our paper adds to the small subset of this literature on large increases, partial compliance, and poverty effects.","2024","2025-10-21 16:43:47","2025-10-21 16:45:04","2025-10-21 16:43:47","398-419","","2","36","","","Bassier (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121475518","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\CFYM9FS4\Bassier Ihsaan and Ranchhod Vimal (2024) Can Minimum Wages Effectively Reduce Poverty under Low Compliance A Case Study from the Agricultura.pdf","","South Africa; POVERTY; Minimum Wages","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121475518","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Bangladesh, a program known as PRIME was introduced in 2006 to address both concerns. Unlike regular microfinance, PRIME introduces a microfinance scheme that offers a flexible repayment schedule and consumption smoothing, as well as production, loans. It targets the ultra-poor, many of whom are also seasonally poor, with a severe inability to smooth consumption during certain months of the year. Besides providing loans, PRIME offers extension and training services. This paper uses a quasi-experimental survey design to evaluate PRIME against regular microfinance programs. e results show that PRIME is more effective than regular microfinance in reaching the ultra-poor, as well as the seasonal poor.

This study aims to provide empirical evidence on the welfare impacts of an ""intensive approach"" adopted under this program. The data for the study come from 4,316 household surveys in 727 villages. The study uses matching methods with the population and socioeconomic census, as well as an instrumental variable approach to construct a retrospective control group. The analysis finds that the program has been able to achieve its primary objective of improving livelihoods by transitioning more women into work. The program has also expanded access to credit, increased the proportion of savings, and reduced interest rates on credit for rural households. This is the first study to estimate the annual income effects of a government-run rural livelihoods program in India, and it shows significant increases in median income across the sample. The results for 30th, 40th, and 75th percentiles are also large and significant. However, the study did not find significant average treatment effects for income.

Suchana is a large-scale program to prevent malnutrition in children in Sylhet division, Bangladesh by improving the livelihoods and nutrition knowledge of poor and very poor households. Suchana is being implemented in 157 unions, the smallest administrative unit of government, in two districts of Sylhet. Suchana will deliver a package of interventions to poor people in about 40 randomly selected new unions annually over 4 years, until all are covered. All beneficiaries will receive the normal government nutrition services. For evaluation purposes the last 40 unions will act as a control for the first 40 intervention unions. The remaining unions will receive the program but will not take part in the evaluation. A baseline survey was conducted in both intervention and control unions; it will be repeated after 3 years to estimate the impact on the prevalence of stunted children and other indicators. This stepped wedge design has several advantages for both the implementation and evaluation of services, as well as some disadvantages. The units of delivery are randomized, which controls for other influences on outcomes; the program supports government service delivery systems, so it is replicable and scalable; and the program can be improved over time as lessons are learned. The main disadvantages are the difficulty of estimating the impact of each component of the program, and the geographical distribution of unions, which increases program delivery costs. Stepped implementation allows a cluster randomized trial to be achieved within a large-scale poverty alleviation program and phased-in and scaled-up over a period of time. This paper may encourage evaluators to consider how to estimate attributable impact by using stepped implementation, which allows the counterfactual group eventually to be treated.","2020","2025-10-21 16:43:37","2025-10-21 16:44:45","2025-10-21 16:43:37","","","744","20","","","Choudhury (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121300045","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\B7W9STZ6\Choudhury Nuzhat Raihan, Mohammad Jyoti, Ahmed, S.

Therefore, in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), efforts to improve outcomes for children with CP (including health-related quality of life, motor function, communication, and nutritional attainments) should also include measures to improve family economic and social capital. We propose a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated microfinance/livelihood and community-based rehabilitation (IMCBR) program for ultra-poor families of children with CP in rural Bangladesh. Material and methods: This will be a cluster RCT comparing three arms: (a) integrated microfinance/livelihood and community-based rehabilitation (IMCBR); (b) community-based rehabilitation (CBR) alone; and (c) care-as-usual (i.e. no intervention). Seven clusters will be recruited within each arm. Each cluster will consist of 10 child-caregiver dyads totalling 21 clusters with 210 dyads. Parents recruited in the IMCBR arm will take part in a microfinance/livelihood program and Parent Training Module (PTM), their children with CP will take part in a Goal Directed Training (GDT) program. The programs will be facilitated by specially trained Community Rehabilitation Officers. The CBR arm includes the same PTM and GDT interventions excluding the microfinance/livelihood program. The care-as-usual arm will be provided with information about early intervention and rehabilitation. The assessors will be blinded to group allocation. The duration of the intervention will be 12 months; outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months.

Data from a randomized evaluation of a Philippine cash transfer program targeted to poor households show that a 9 percent increase in village income significantly raised the prices of perishable protein-rich foods while leaving other food prices unaffected. The price changes are largest in areas with the highest program saturation, where the shock to village income is on the order of 15 percent and persists more than 2.5 years after program introduction. Although significantly improving nutrition related outcomes among beneficiary children, the cash transfer worsened those same indicators among non-beneficiary children. The stunting rate of young non-beneficiary children increased by eleven percentage points, with even greater increases in the most saturated areas. Another potentially related spillover arises in local health markets: formal health care utilization by mothers and children also declined among non-beneficiary households. Failing to consider such local general equilibrium effects can overstate the net benefit of targeted cash transfers. In areas where individual targeting of social programs covers the majority of households, offering the program on a universal basis should avoid such negative impacts at little additional cost.","2018","2025-10-21 16:43:39","2025-10-21 16:44:37","2025-10-21 16:43:39","62-pp","","8377","","","","Filmer (2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121312812","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\B5T62JZQ\WPS8377.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121312812","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A challenge to improving psychosocial health is that its associations with risk factors are complicated, inadequately understood, and difficult to modify, and/or require action outside the health sector. Background: We capitalized on the quasi-experimental assignment of a poverty-alleviation program for the ultra-poor in Bangladesh to investigate how this program affected 2 aspects of psychosocial health; distress, (i.e., the negative cognitive appraisal of stress) and subjective well-being (i.e., satisfaction with domains of life), and the importance of food insecurity as a mediator relative to other stressors and economic status. Methods: The study was conducted in 3 northern districts of Bangladesh where the program operated. The ultra-poor households were selected through a multistage selection process. The economically better-off households were excluded during the process and included as study controls. The program supported women by providing income-earning opportunities, strengthening sociopolitical livelihood, and building self-awareness and self-confidence. Data were collected in 2006 from 209 women on demography, psychosocial health, and stressors (i.e., domestic violence, food insecurity, economic status, perceived economy, and emotional social constraints). Data collected in 2002 from the same individuals were used to control for the baseline differences between groups. By using path analysis we showed the direct and indirect effects of the program on distress and well-being. Results: The program positively affected psychosocial health by alleviating stressors. The indirect effect of the program contributed 74% in reducing distress and 30% in improving well-being. Food insecurity was by far the most important mediator, explaining 50% of indirect effect on distress and 66% of the indirect effect on well-being. Conclusion: Food insecurity is modifiable and an appropriate target for poverty-alleviation and agricultural programs. These findings suggest programmatic and policy attention to the social dimensions of poor psychosocial health, particularly to food insecurity as a central cause.","2015","2025-10-21 16:43:39","2025-10-21 16:44:32","2025-10-21 16:43:39","1934-1941","","8","145","","","Jalal (2015)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121315736","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\AQIIETTC\Jalal C S.

Most of these programs are widely credited with providing the poor access to food and improving their livelihoods. However, the need for assistance is overwhelming. According to the latest poverty estimates, 24.3 percent of the country's 163 million people were poor in 2016.1 Improving program targeting to reach the poorest of the poor effectively is needed to address the wide gap between the resources available for safety net programs and those in need of support. Targeting effectiveness indicates the extent to which program benefits are received by the neediest versus the less needy or non-needy population. A well-targeted food intervention improves the real income and food security of the neediest without providing those benefits to members of the society who do not need them. Targeting of benefits to those most in need is an obvious way of reducing the costs of a program. Upon request of the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MOWCA) and the World Food Programme (WFP) in Bangladesh, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has undertaken this study to assess the suitability of indicators used for targeting the poor through the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) program in Bangladesh.

Such interventions may have little demonstrated effect not only due to implementation issues but also because they do not address school experience variables that influence student outcomes.

We provide estimates of the impact of a national unconditional cash transfer program, the Kenya Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children, on pregnancy and early marriage among females aged 12 to 24, four years after program initiation. The evaluation was designed as a clustered randomized controlled trial and ran from 2007 to 2011, capitalizing on the existence of a control group, which was delayed entry to the program due to budget constraints. Findings indicate that, among 1549 females included in the study, while the program reduced the likelihood of pregnancy by five percentage points, there was no significant impact on likelihood of early marriage. Program impacts on pregnancy appear to work through increasing the enrollment of young women in school, financial stability of the household and delayed age at first sex. The Kenyan program is similar in design to most other major national cash transfer programs in Eastern and Southern Africa, suggesting a degree of generalizability of the results reported here. Although the objective of the program is primarily poverty alleviation, it appears to have an important impact on facilitating the successful transition of adolescent girls into adulthood.","2015","2025-10-21 16:43:39","2025-10-30 16:36:26","2025-10-21 16:43:39","36-45","","C","141","","","Handa (2015)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752182","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\42GHJMHB\Handa S et al.

Further, after intervention, there was a significant improvement in hand-washing behaviour: before cutting vegetables, preparing food, feeding a child and eating, and after defecating and cleaning a baby (p<0.05). Also, the target group was more likely to moderately and briefly boil their vegetables and were 19% less likely to use maximum heat when cooking vegetables than the control group (p<0.01).

Evidence from BRAC's challenging the frontiers of poverty reduction-targeting the ultra poor program in Bangladesh","IFPRI - Discussion Papers","","","","http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01317.pdf","Growing evidence shows that the distribution of individuals' ownership and control of assets within a household can have important implications for women's empowerment and children's well-being. Interventions that target assets to specific individuals can shift these intrahousehold dynamics, yet little evidence exists from rigorous evaluations. We study BRAC's Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction-Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) program in Bangladesh, which targets asset transfer (primarily livestock) and training to rural women in poor households. Previous research has shown large, significant positive program impacts at the household level. In this paper, we examine intrahousehold impacts using mixed methods. We focus on the Specially Targeted Ultra-Poor (STUP) component of the program, which targets households selected following a randomized controlled trial design. Adding a new round of data collection with quantitative sex-disaggregated information and qualitative exploration, we exploit the randomized design to assess intrahousehold impacts of STUP. Our analysis confirms that the program significantly increases household ownership of various assets but has complex effects on the targeted women. Quantitative estimates show increases in women's sole and joint ownership of or control over transferred assets such as livestock, but a much greater increase in men's sole ownership over nearly all other assets (including agricultural and nonagricultural productive assets, land, and consumer durables). These findings suggest that while the transferred assets tend to remain with women, new investments from mobilized resources are controlled by men. Moreover, the program reduces women's mobility outside the home and their control over income, consistent with the transferred asset's requiring maintenance at home. Qualitative findings are consistent with these quantitative results, but women's contribution to their households is perceived as increasing their confidence and social capital, which they themselves value. Therefore, while provision of assets and training to women has ambiguous effects on women's empowerment in terms of tangible assets and decisionmaking, women take intangibles into account and largely perceive positive (though still mixed) effects. The analysis shows that asset transfer targeted to women can increase women's ownership of and control over the transferred asset itself but may not necessarily increase women's intrahousehold bargaining position. Moreover, it reveals that outcomes valued by individuals may not always be tangible, highlighting the complexity of assessing whether interventions improve women's empowerment.","2013","2025-10-21 16:43:39","2025-10-21 16:44:14","2025-10-21 16:43:39","vi-pp","","1317","","","","Narayan (2013)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121317383","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\Z79KZAHH\DP11.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121317383","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Triple difference estimates suggest that participants significantly increase consumption (protein and energy intake) in the short run and accumulate more nonfinancial assets in the medium term.

The analysis spans the 2011 to 2019 period, during which the share of rural households covered by high-speed broadband increased from 14.5% to 83%. The empirical strategy exploits variations in the timing of network deployment, as well as the fact that several rural areas remained unserved by 2019. To estimate impact, the study uses a semi-parametric alternative to the standard two-way fixed-effects (TWFE) estimator proposed by Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021). Overall, the findings indicate that broadband deployment in rural areas is associated with measurable gains in labor income and employment. Our income model estimates range from an increase of 14% to 21% above the expected level had broadband not been deployed in these areas. The impact estimates on employment are more modest, ranging from 3% to 5% (depending on the specification) above the mean employment level over the study period. Additionally, our results corroborate that&nbsp;ICTs&nbsp;help diversify employment opportunities, as the share of agricultural employment falls in the connected areas.

While such programs are often implemented electronically in developed countries, in many developing countries with weak financial infrastructure, such transfers are distributed manually, resulting in significant costs to program recipients and the public sector alike. The introduction of mobile money systems in many developing countries offers new opportunities for distributing cash transfers. Using data from a randomized experiment of a mobile money cash transfer program in Niger, we find evidence of benefits of this new system: household diet diversity was 9%–16% higher among households who received mobile transfers, and children ate an additional one-third of a meal per day. These results can be partially attributed to time savings associated with mobile transfers, as program recipients spent less time traveling to and waiting for their transfer. They are also associated with shifts in intra household bargaining power for women. These results suggest that electronic transfers may address key logistical challenges in implementing cash transfer programs in developing countries but that sufficient investment in the payments infrastructure is needed.","2016","2025-10-21 16:43:45","2025-10-21 15:11:43","2025-10-21 16:43:45","1-37","","1","65","","","Aker (2016)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121475501","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\WD5LL7J6\Aker C J et al.

It differs from existing literature by differences in geographic coverage, time span, and use of self-reported household benefits across a broad range of programs. Reservation of chief executive (pradhan) positions in local government for women was associated with a significant worsening of within-village targeting to SC/ST households, and no improvement on any other dimension of targeting. Reservation of pradhan posts for SC/ST members was associated with a significant increase in benefits received by the village as a whole, improvement in intra-village targeting to female-headed households, and to the group (SC or ST) of the pradhan. The effects of women's reservations are not consistent with simple citizen-candidate or elite capture models of electoral politics. They are consistent with a more complex hypothesis of capture-cum-clientelism which is weakened by election of politically inexperienced women to reserved pradhan posts.","2010","2025-10-21 16:43:45","2025-10-30 16:36:25","2025-10-21 16:43:45","1-36","","1","1","","","Bardhan (2010)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752180","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\6994YNI2\Bardhan Pranab K et al.

In the wake of climate change, on-farm plantation forestry has evolved to include carbon forestry, with the dual purpose of sequestering carbon and improving rural livelihoods. However, there is a dearth of empirical evidence regarding whether and under what conditions on-farm plantation forestry can deliver favorable livelihood outcomes. Therefore, Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and endogenous switching regression models were used to estimate the average treatment effects of adopting eucalyptus and carbon forestry woodlots (under the planvivo system) on consumption expenditure per adult equivalent and daily calorie acquisition per adult equivalent. PSM and switching regression results consistently indicated that adoption of eucalyptus woodlots increased consumption expenditure by 32 and 28.3% respectively. PSM and switching regression results also indicated that adoption of eucalyptus woodlots increased calorie acquisition per adult equivalent by 36 and 13.1% respectively. Results also indicated that adoption of carbon forestry increased calorie acquisition per adult equivalent by between 22 and 26.9% but the impact on consumption expenditure per adult equivalent was mixed. The findings of this study provide empirical evidence that adoption of on-farm eucalyptus woodlots is an important pathway for smallholder farmers to escape poverty and improve food security. Similarly, adoption of carbon forestry woodlots under the planvivo system can improve food security. However, previous on-farm plantation forestry projects were not well targeted to the poor households.","2016","2025-10-21 16:43:45","2025-10-21 15:11:43","2025-10-21 16:43:45","150-163","","1","9","","","Kiyingi (2016)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121475505","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\QSFLNZQX\Kiyingi I et al.

Access to irrigation increases household consumption by 27-30% relative to water-recession and rain-fed cultivators. The paper also investigates whether irrigation has secondary impacts on risk-mitigating strategies by reducing covariate risk and reinforcing informal food sharing networks that allow households to insure against idiosyncratic risk. We find that households with irrigation save between 4.5 and 6.4 more tropical livestock units and are 20% more likely to engage in informal food sharing with non-irrigators.

However, there is limited empirical evidence on the welfare effects of these programs. This article considers one such program, the Zambian Food Reserve Agency (FRA), which purchases maize from smallholder farmers at a pan-territorial price that typically exceeds maize market prices in surplus production areas. Using both fixed effects and an instrumental variables approach combined with correlated random effects, we estimate the effects of the FRA's maize marketing activities on smallholder farm household welfare. Results suggest that FRA activities have positive direct welfare effects on the small minority of smallholder households that are able to sell to it. However, the results also suggest negative indirect FRA effects, as higher levels of FRA activity in a district are associated with higher levels of poverty.","2015","2025-10-21 16:43:47","2025-10-21 15:11:43","2025-10-21 16:43:47","","","","","","","Fung (2015)","","","","Institute for Study of Labor (IZA) Discussion Paper","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121475517      DOI: No DOI","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\IBXSETZT\dp9361.pdf","","Poverty; Income; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zambia; Maize; Smallholder Farmers; Crop Marketing Boards; Strategic Grain Reserves","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121475517","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seasonal hunger, also known as monga in greater Rangpur, is caused by a deprivation of food during certain months of the year when households do not have adequate employment, income, and savings. That is, monga is an ex post measure of seasonal deprivation of food. However, for policymaking purpose, knowing who are going to be in seasonal hunger in future is more important than knowing who already are. This ex post measure of seasonal food deprivation through the changes in consumption ordering in two years- 2008 and 2007 can be defined as food consumption vulnerability. That is, vulnerability to seasonal hunger is the likelihood of remaining in or falling into seasonal hunger. Households smooth consumption via income smoothing and other measures, which also reduce their vulnerability to monga. When consumption smoothing does not happen for one reason or another, food deprivation is sure to follow.","2010","2025-10-21 16:43:47","2025-10-21 15:11:43","2025-10-21 16:43:47","","","","","","","Hasan (2010)","","","","MPRA Working Papers","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121475511      DOI: No DOI","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\Q46L5AU8\MPRA_paper_28192.pdf","","Bangladesh; Credit; Extreme Poor; Food consumption vulnerability","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121475511","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CCTs, as well as other cash subsidies, have been criticized for allegedly crowding out private transfers. Whether social programs crowd out private transfers is an important question with worrisome implications, as private support represents an important fraction of households'income and works as a risk sharing mechanism in developing countries. Furthermore, empirical evidence on the effect of public transfers on private transfers is mixed. This paper contributes to the literature by using a unique dataset from the quasi-experimental evaluation of a CCT in Colombia and an empirical strategy that allows us to correct for pre-existing differences between treated and control groups. Our results suggest that the public transfer did not crowd out private transfers, neither in the short-run nor in the middle-run. Instead, it increased the probability of receiving support in cash, in kind, and in non-paid labor from different private sources by approximately 10 percentage points. Moreover, we find that the monetary value of private transfers increased by 32-38% for treated households. © The Author(s), 2020.

It discusses short- and long-term implications of access to microcredit on income poverty. Design/methodology/approach The authors interviewed rural households with agriculture being either their first or second income-creating activity. All sampled households are clients of a Cameroonian village bank. The authors used a balanced panel with a treatment and a control group, the latter not having had a village bank microcredit yet. The results were reaffirmed using bootstrapping. Findings This paper argues that microcredit has had a significant positive impact on per capita income in the short run, but the long-term effect was negative, albeit not significant. In the long run, absolute income poverty had further decreased in the treatment group, however, not as much as in the control group. Because the treatment group had been shifting back to the informal financial sector and had diverted part of the microcredit for consumption, this may have led to lower marginal income effects. Productivity of credit financed inputs by the treatment group remained constant, which also explains why the treatment group fell back over time. Research limitations/implications The balanced panel data set was relatively small due to attrition over time. This was accounted for using bootstrapping. Nevertheless, research results must be interpreted with care. Furthermore, the discussion is not exhaustive. Practical implications Despite tremendous methodological advancements regarding the impact analysis of microcredit on income poverty, findings remain controversial and inconsistent. Frequently, fungibility is a confounding issue. Microcredit policy ought to consider more long-term effects. Originality/value There is much discourse amongst development economists about the impact of microcredit on poverty. Research based on panel data may clarify some of the controversial issues. This research paper uses a rather unique panel data set from Cameroonian farm households that are clients of a private sector village bank. The issue of sample size limitation is dealt with using bootstrapping. The authors base the empirical analysis on a comprehensive and theoretically founded economic farm household model.","2019","2025-10-21 16:43:47","2025-10-30 16:36:31","2025-10-21 16:43:47","386-407","","3","79","","","Buchenrieder (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752201","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\9I8CMKZV\Buchenrieder Gertrud et al.

When private consumption brings public benefits, this same heterogeneity can be used to target public subsidies. We explore the design of public–private targeting and segmentation strategies in the case of a resource-conserving agricultural technology in India. To understand farmers’ heterogeneous demand for laser land leveling (LLL), we conducted an experimental auction for LLL services with an integrated randomized controlled trial to estimate the private benefits of the technology. We use graphical and econometric approaches to characterize farmer demand for LLL. We then add detailed cost data from LLL providers to simulate and evaluate several potential targeted delivery strategies based on measures of (1) the cost-effectiveness of expanding LLL dissemination, (2) water savings, and (3) market surplus in a welfare framework. These simulations demonstrate inherent tradeoffs between increasing the amount of land that is leveled and expanding the number of farmers who adopt the technology, and between adoption and water savings. While segmenting and targeting are popular elements of many public–private partnerships to develop and disseminate agricultural technologies, formulating and implementing effective delivery strategies requires a rich understanding of costs, benefits, and demand. Our experimental approach generates such an understanding and may be relevant in other contexts.","2013","2025-10-21 16:43:47","2025-10-30 16:36:40","2025-10-21 16:43:47","","","","","","","Lybbert (2013)","","","","IFPRI - Discussion Papers","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752231        DOI: No DOI","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\93DBT27C\127957.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752231","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The economic impact of these subsidies has been quantitatively evaluated for various nations in the literature using different approaches. However, the impact of energy subsidies on social wellbeing tracked by looking at school drop-out, health status, and earning capacity through mediating effects of energy poverty employing mediation analysis using household-level data is rarely investigated, particularly for energy-poor countries. Thus, by employing mediation analysis with data from three waves of the national Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) of Bangladesh for the years 2005, 2010, and 2016, this study intends to reveal the mediating effects of energy subsidies on social wellbeing via energy poverty. The results obtained utilizing a mixed-effect regression approach suggest that energy subsidies and energy poverty are significantly linked, and energy subsidies improve social wellbeing by mediating effects of energy poverty. This finding is robust to alternative ways of addressing endogeneity using Lewbel's two-stage least squares (2SLS) method. Additionally, the richer households realize better social wellbeing and have less energy poverty, gaining more than other households from energy subsidies. The policy relevance of this paper advocates further innovation in energy subsidy reforms in energy-poor countries for combating energy poverty and ensuring clean, sustainable, and affordable energy for all in line with the aims of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) 7, affordable and clean energy.","2023","2025-10-21 16:43:47","2025-10-21 15:11:43","2025-10-21 16:43:47","","","","100","","","Hosan (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121475514","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\8SR34JDF\1-s2.0-S2214629623001482-main.pdf","","Social wellbeing; Energy Poverty; Energy subsidies; Energy price; Price-gap","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121475514","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, farm-level meat consumption increased from the slaughter of one sheep per year to three. These outcomes inspire hope for the future of sustainable animal productivity. Despite being launched in 2009 with the collaboration and support of research institutes, livestock extension services, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), the International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), and BOKU, the participation of Ethiopian universities in the CBBP was notably lacking, considering their extensive reach across all regions and diverse Agro-ecological settings. The scaling approach initiated based on the framework developed by Mueller et al. (2019) has triggered the engagement of more partners, including universities, in the expansion of sheep and goat CBBPs. Ethiopian Universities are latecomers; however, they are supported by more than 62 CBBP villages, benefitting 6300 households and investing 1.2 million USD in enhancing teaching, research and community engagement. The practice and knowledge of CBBP are also integrated into the curriculum by influencing the curriculum policy. More than 31 curricula that benefited more than 1120 students per year have integrated CBBP into the UG programs. The lessons from the undergraduate (UG) programs have also given the impetus to integrate CBBP into the postgraduate (PG) program, and more than 43 curricula have integrated CBBP into the curricula, which benefits 345 students per year. The survey conducted to ascertain the relevance of supporting and establishing CBBP under the support of universities and the integration of the CBBP knowledge in the curriculum is highly (88-100%) endorsed in the face of the university community.","2024-12","2025-10-17 13:53:46","2025-10-21 13:21:39","2025-10-17 13:53:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","Publisher: International Livestock Research Institute","","","","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We cannot disentangle the impacts of the farm planning program and the lump sum transfer that comprised that program. In Malawi, we observe that over two years male program recipients exhibit increased decisionmaking power, while male non-recipients see reductions in decision-making power. These results are broadly due to both the transfers and the intensive agricultural support services. Changes in decision power seem to flow not just from control of income, but also from shifting household norms linked to program participation.

The SPIR-II aims to enhance livelihoods, increase resilience to shocks, and improve food security and nutrition for rural households vulnerable to food insecurity in Ethiopia. The IMPEL SPIR-II impact evaluation employs an experimental design with multiple treatment arms, comparing combinations of livelihood and nutrition graduation model programming provided to the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) beneficiaries relative to a control group receiving only PSNP transfers. The design includes 234 kebeles assigned to three treatment arms. In the first arm (the control group), PSNP is implemented by the government with SPIR II support for the provision of cash and food transfers only. In the second arm, SPIR II programming is rolled out to PSNP beneficiary households in conjunction with nurturing care groups targeting enhanced infant and young child nutritional practices. In the third arm, PSNP beneficiary households receive SPIR II programming and NCGs, supplemented with additional targeted cash grants. Specifically, it includes data collected from the baseline survey of the RCT conducted in August September 2022, which entailed interviews with both the primary female respondent (pregnant or lactating woman) and her spouse. The sample for the baseline survey comprises 3,015 households in 234 kebeles from 15 woredas in the Amhara and Oromia regions. The inclusion criteria required that households were PSNP beneficiaries reporting the presence of an infant under nine months of age (along with his/her mother or primary caretaker) or a pregnant woman. The realized sample corresponds to 98% of the target sample; three kebeles were excluded from the sample due to insecurity or other challenges that rendered it impossible to conduct surveys.","2025-02-20","2025-10-17 14:21:30","2025-10-21 13:20:45","2025-10-17 14:21:30","","","","","","","Strengthen PSNP Institutions and Resilience Phase II (SPIR II), Ethiopia","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Graduate students are well positioned for this broader role, particularly when supported by graduate programs. We ask: (1) how can graduate students effectively engage in knowledge exchange during their research; and (2) how can university programs prepare young scientists to take on this partnership role? We present a conceptual framework with three levels at which graduate students can exchange knowledge with stakeholders (information sharing, skill building, and knowledge generation) and discuss limitations of each. Examples of these strategies included disseminating preliminary research results to southern African villages, building research skills of Brazilian undergraduate students through semester-long internships, and jointly developing and implementing a forest ecology research and training program with one community in the Amazon estuary. Students chose strategies based on stakeholders' interests, research goals, and a realistic evaluation of student capacity and skill set. As strategies became more complex, time invested, skills mobilized, and strength of relationships between students and stakeholders increased. Graduate programs can prepare students for knowledge exchange with partners by developing specialized skills training, nurturing external networks, offering funding, maximizing strengths of universities in developed and developing regions through partnership, and evaluating knowledge exchange experiences. While balancing the needs of academia with those of stakeholders is challenging, the benefits of enhancing local scientific capacity and generating more locally relevant research for improved conservation may be worth the risks associated with implementing this type of graduate training model.","2009","2025-10-17 13:39:13","2025-10-30 14:04:04","2025-10-17 13:39:13","","","","","","","Graduate students and knowledge exchange with local stakeholders","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121748132","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\CRA24SGH\Duchelle et al. - 2009 - Graduate students and knowledge exchange with local stakeholders possibilities and preparation.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121748132","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These offer critical financial lifelines to vulnerable households, aiming to alleviate poverty by providing steady cash support. However, these programs can become long-term fiscal burdens for governments due to limited turnover of recipients, particularly when the programs do not lead to lasting reductions in poverty. To address this problem, economic inclusion programs (including so-called “poverty graduation” programs) are increasingly being introduced as complementary or alternative approaches. Economic inclusion programs aim to provide a cohesive set of mutually reinforcing interventions to help individuals sustainably move out of poverty. Governments are also increasingly interested in seeing if these programs can “graduate” households from relying on cash transfers.","2024-12-18","2025-10-17 13:41:07","2025-10-21 13:20:29","2025-10-17 13:41:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","","","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors evaluate the impact of a program that gives scholarships to girls making the transition between the last year of primary school and the first year of secondary school in Cambodia. They show that the scholarship program had a large, positive effect on the school enrollment and attendance of girls. Their preferred set of estimates suggests program effects on enrollment and attendance at program schools of 30 to 43 percentage points. Scholarship recipients were also more likely to be enrolled at any scchool (not just program schools) by a margin of 22 to 33 percentage points. The impact of the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) program appears to have been largest among girls with the lowest socioeconomic status at baseline.

Here we highlight the significance of program-level learning analytics, where the relationships between courses become clear, and the impact of early-stage courses on program outcomes such as graduation or drop-out can be understood. We present a matrix model of student progression through a program as a tool to gain valuable insight into program continuity and design. We demonstrate its use in a real program and examine the impact upon progression and graduation rate if course-level changes were made early on. We also extend the model to more complex scenarios such as multiple program pathways and simultaneous courses.

Therefore, in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), efforts to improve outcomes for children with CP (including health-related quality of life, motor function, communication, and nutritional attainments) should also include measures to improve family economic and social capital. We propose a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated microfinance/livelihood and community-based rehabilitation (IMCBR) program for ultra-poor families of children with CP in rural Bangladesh. Material and methods This will be a cluster RCT comparing three arms: (a) integrated microfinance/livelihood and community-based rehabilitation (IMCBR); (b) community-based rehabilitation (CBR) alone; and (c) care-as-usual (i.e. no intervention). Seven clusters will be recruited within each arm. Each cluster will consist of 10 child-caregiver dyads totalling 21 clusters with 210 dyads. Parents recruited in the IMCBR arm will take part in a microfinance/livelihood program and Parent Training Module (PTM), their children with CP will take part in a Goal Directed Training (GDT) program. The programs will be facilitated by specially trained Community Rehabilitation Officers. The CBR arm includes the same PTM and GDT interventions excluding the microfinance/livelihood program. The care-as-usual arm will be provided with information about early intervention and rehabilitation. The assessors will be blinded to group allocation. The duration of the intervention will be 12 months; outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. Conclusion This will be the first RCT of an integrated microfinance/livelihood and CBR program for children with CP in LMIC settings. Evidence from the study could transform approaches to improving wellbeing of children with CP and their ultra-poor families. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-10-21 16:43:43","2025-10-30 16:36:36","2025-10-21 16:43:43","","","12 December","16","","","Al Imam (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752218","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\6LZHBFQP\Al Imam M H et al.

The first two are components of the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) program: (1) Income- Generating VGD (IGVGD) and (2) Food Security VGD (FSVGD). The last two are the (3) Food for Asset Creation (FFA) component of the Integrated Food Security (IFS) program and the (4) Rural Maintenance Program (RMP). In 2006, these programs covered 830,840 beneficiaries with 3.72 million family members. The IGVGD program exclusively targets poor women, who receive a monthly food ration over a period of 24 months. IGVGD also has a built-in mechanism to provide credit to its participants. The FSVGD program also targets poor women and provides a combination of food and cash to program participants. The FFA component of IFS distributes a combination of food and cash as wage payments to workers in labor-intensive public works programs. Although both men and women participate in FFA, the program requires that at least 70 percent of the participants be women. In contrast, RMP targets only women, who receive cash wages for maintaining rural roads. The evaluation assesses the operational performance of food or cash transfer delivery; beneficiary preferences for the form of transfers; the accuracy of targeting; the impacts of program participation on food security, livelihood, and gender-related outcomes; and the cost-effectiveness of transfers. In doing so, the study draws on both qualitative and quantitative survey data from beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries. Gender-disaggregated information was collected wherever it was meaningful. The quantitative assessments of impact rely heavily on the propensity score matching (PSM) method of impact evaluation -the most appropriate approach given that these programs had already been implemented when the household survey for the study was carried out. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2010","2025-10-21 16:43:43","2025-10-30 16:36:21","2025-10-21 16:43:43","1-248","","163","","","","Ahmed (2010)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752163","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\95G9ZTFY\Ahmed A U et al.

The graduation program provided poor households enrolled in Ethiopia’s national safety net, the Productive Safety Net Program, with additional livelihood programming including savings groups and agricultural and livestock value-chain training. In addition, extremely poor households received a one-time livelihood grant as cash transfers or in-kind poultry grants at a value much smaller than lump-sum transfers in other graduation model programs. The experiment compared a core nutrition model of nutrition information and sanitation and hygiene activities with an enhanced model that added more intensive nutrition messaging. Results show that interaction with health-care workers and participation in community health activities increased significantly under the enhanced nutrition model, as did maternal nutritional knowledge. Neither the core nutrition model with grants nor the enhanced nutrition model without grants led to significant improvements in child dietary diversity or anthropometric outcomes. However, poultry livelihood grants complemented the enhanced nutrition model and increased child dietary diversity, while cash livelihood grants plus the enhanced nutrition model reduced childhood stunting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-10-21 16:43:43","2025-10-16 23:14:05","2025-10-21 16:43:43","1559-1604","","3","73","","","Alderman (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121355522","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\JRW6XX3M\732179.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121355522","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing upon mixed-method data analysis, participatory assessment, and case studies from six projects in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Mexico involving 936 households with PWDs, this article discusses graduation programme design for PWDs in extreme poverty.

This allows us to estimate the program effects on the target group, not contaminated by mistargeting. To address selection on unobservables, we implement heteroskedasticity-based identification and two recent estimators based on matching and propensity score reweighting. The results show that participation had significant positive effects on food security, clothing, shoes, livestock, and cash savings, but there is weak or no evidence of an impact on the number of household durables and assets and indicators of health and women's empowerment. The effects on the poorest of the poor (the target group) may be different from the effects on an average participant in the TUP program. When one takes into account the differences in initial conditions, the effects of the TUP program on the poorest of the poor are much larger (as measured by the program effect normalized by the initial mean value of an outcome), which suggests that the TUP program would have had a larger impact with better targeting.","2014","2025-10-21 16:43:42","2025-10-16 22:53:50","2025-10-21 16:43:42","339-80","","2","62","","","Emran (2014)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121336028","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\P7HVF2SZ\Emran M Shahe, Robano, Virginia, Smith, Stephen C (2014) Assessing the Frontiers of Ultrapoverty Reduction Evidence from Challenging the Frontiers of Povert.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121336028","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We match three rounds of household survey data to detailed satellite weather data to identify community-level exposure to droughts. We then exploit random assignment to the graduation program to evaluate whether exposed households show heterogeneous effects of drought on household food security and livestock holdings, women’s diets and nutritional status, and prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV). We find that droughts have substantial negative effects on these outcomes, but the intervention serves to consistently moderate these effects, and for some outcomes (particularly diets and nutrition and IPV), the intervention fully protects households from any adverse drought affects.

Learnings in this case will focus on documenting best practices for consideration that will ensure the “Graduation Approach” is tailored to meet the needs of extremely poor persons living with disabilities. The DIG Considerations are tailored to ensure all core Graduation Approach Pillars are adapted to meet the various needs of ultra-poor persons with disabilities. Adapting graduation pillars further ensures that reasonable accommodation is available throughout all program interventions to support ultra-poor persons with disabilities who have barriers to active participation in development initiatives bridged to create opportunities for them to increase their functional autonomy.

An increasing number of governments are adopting and scaling economic inclusion programs, including Graduation programs, to address the multidimensional vulnerabilities of people living in extreme poverty. By integrating the Graduation approach into their poverty reduction initiatives, governments can increase the impact and scale of their initiatives by investing in the systems, processes, and capacities needed to reach those furthest behind and deliver multidimensional, timebound, and sequenced program interventions. This In Practice paper shares insights and learning from four non-governmental organizations on the potential to scale up government-led Graduation programs for people living in extreme poverty. It contributes to the growing policy space around economic inclusion and identifies good practices for designing and implementing government-led Graduation programs. It makes recommendations and identifies key considerations for governments on how to identify, reach, and deliver impactful programming to individuals and households facing socioeconomic exclusion and marginalization.","2023","2025-10-17 16:17:37","2025-10-21 19:05:46","2025-10-16 22:55:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476555","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\2VKCIJFY\content.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476555","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the great diversity of agricultural tasks and the varied production systems and crops demand a wide range of solutions that can be adapted to robotic vehicles as a power source. These alternatives must be affordable and user-friendly for some users, although more sophisticated solutions must also be developed for others, depending on their specific needs. For this, the present work focuses on the development of two maize seeders with different metering systems coupled to an agricultural robot. The first seeder has a conventional mechanically driven seed metering system with a drive wheel and chain gear, while the second one has an electronically driven metering system based on a DC motor and a digital encoder controlled by a microcontroller. Both seeders were coupled to a remote-controlled robotic vehicle and evaluated on real farmland. Seed distribution in the seed rows was contrasting; the results indicated that the mechanical system performed better in the field than the electronic system. For both seeders, the working capacity was approximately 0.135 ha/h at an average speed of 2.0 km/h. The proposed robot–seeder assembly could help farmers automate and reduce the workload associated with planting, as well as attract young people to the field.","2024-12","2025-10-17 14:01:05","2025-10-21 19:05:46","2025-10-17 14:01:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476554  Publisher: MDPI","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\FCPLV9UD\López-Gómez et al. - 2024 - Design and comparison of two maize seeders coupled with an agricultural robot.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476554","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flood-based irrigation while inexpensive is rooted in tradition in many rural communities which is in contrast to many other irrigation types which are unavailable (in terms of water source, technology or capacity) or are costly to develop. Spate irrigation has been practiced in different parts of Ethiopia for many decades, but it was only recently that it gained the government’s attention. This study was conducted through a review and informal discussion with the objectives of documenting the current status, trends and prospects of spate irrigation in the country and the associated challenges, taking cases of selected schemes in different regional states. The study revealed that spate irrigation is expanding either through improvement of traditional schemes or by developing new ones. Neither the traditional nor modern schemes are free of challenges. The traditional schemes suffer from floods that damage their diversion structures, while poor design and construction of diversion structures have led to the failure of new ones. A range of socio-technical improvements in the planning, implementation and operation of schemes is proposed, including the design of headworks and canals consistent with the size and nature of expected flows, structures to minimize sedimentation, building capacity of farmers and district officers, and monitoring and improving the management that currently adversely impacts the performance of the schemes. Consulting farmers at every stage of the development, and building the capacity of engineers to deal with the unique nature of spate flows are the most likely interventions to ensure successful agricultural production using spate irrigation.","2014","2025-10-17 13:58:03","2025-10-21 19:05:44","2025-10-17 13:58:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476547","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\TZV7JV68\Erkossa et al. - 2014 - Constraints to the development, operation and maintenance of spate irrigation schemes in Ethiopia.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476547","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cross-section survey was used to obtain data from a sample of 283 respondents purposively selected from previous hosts of student outreach of Gulu University in Uganda. Results from Kruskal-Wallis method revealed that there were significant differences among host-farmers with respect to farmstead distance to the university for knowledge sharing (?2 (2) = 8.5; P < 0.05) and giving feedback (?2 (2) = 7.6; P < 0.05). Regarding the experience of participating in outreach program, significant differences among host-farmers were found in seeking information (?2 (2) = 12.3; P < 0.01); knowledge sharing (?2 (2) = 10.4; P < 0.01); seeking feedback (?2 (2) = 16.4; P < 0.01) and giving feedback (?2 (2) = 8.1; P < 0.05). Further, Friedman test results showed that host-farmers perceived the university-student outreach to be superior and significantly different from public and non-public agricultural extension. We conclude that university outreach is a useful service to farmer. However, its success in facilitating farmer learning is dependent on farmstead distance to the university and farmers’ level of experience of participating in university activities. We recommend more logistical support from governments to university outreach programs so that outreach services can efficiently complement public and non-public interventions in delivering community-based training and learning approaches.","2019-01-14","2025-10-17 13:58:53","2025-10-21 19:05:44","2025-10-17 13:58:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476548","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\ZDZ6Z5YM\Kalule et al. - 2019 - Contextual determinants of learning behaviour differentials amongst host-farmers of University-stude.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476548","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A structured questionnaire and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) methods relevant to rural poultry production were used to collect data. Using a stratified random sampling technique, hundred and sixty households were included in the survey. The result showed that the main objectives of chicken production in the study area were for sale (44%), replacement (34%) and consumption (22%) and that of eggs used for hatching (47%), sale (33 %) and home consumption (20 %). The most dominant chicken production system in the study area was a subsistence extensive system which is based on indigenous chickens with scavenging and seasonal supplementary feeding of homegrown grains and household food refusals. The overall mean flock size for the three weredas was 9.22±0.35 with a range of 3 -26. Nearly all (97.6 %) of the respondents do not have a separate house to their chickens and only 10% of the respondents have access to veterinary services. Poultry production was managed based on indigenous or local knowledge they have acquired over their lifetime. The high hatchability (89.1 %) and mortality (80%) are the two conflicting feature of the system. Men and women took 35 % and 24.4% ownership respectively. The major decision role belongs to men. However, the major management was the responsibility of women. The overall average age at first egg was 7.07±0.08 ranging 5-10 months. The average egg production per clutch was 14.9±0.23 ranging (6-26) with a mean 3.7±0.04 clutches per year ranging 2-5 clutches with a clutch length of 26.2±0.41 days. The overall mean cock: hen ratio was 1:2.2. Chickens in Wonsho (Dega) wereda showed significantly (p<0.05) best performance with the highest egg production (62.95 eggs/hen/year), lowest chick mortality (45.15) and highest clutches per year (3.8) compared to other Weredas. The mean live-weights for matured male and female at farm Gate were 1.58±.02 (kg) and 1.30±.02 (kg), respectively. The corresponding price for matured male and female at farm gate were 21.74±0.54 and 13.95±0.43 birr, respectively in during ordinary days. More than half of the respondents (65%) do not have any information about the price of the chicken. Only 31.67% of the volumes of sale pass directly to the consumer. Critical constraints of the smallholder poultry production in the study area were partly due to the prevailing poor management practices, in particular predation, lack of proper health care, and poor housing. It was concluded that efforts have to be made to shift the production paradigm to semi intensive focusing on market oriented production based on scavenging with a holistic support of services such as health, housing, extension, credit and marketing to make it productive and sustainable.","2007-11","2025-10-17 14:09:52","2025-10-21 19:05:41","2025-10-17 14:09:52","","","","","","","","","","","","Hawassa University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476536","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\IWCL63PR\Gebre-Egziabher - 2007 - Characterization of smallholder poultry production and marketing system of Dale, Wonsho and Loka Aba.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476536","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was conducted to determine the participation of sheep farmers in sheep fattening cooperatives (SFC) in four regional states of Ethiopia with a special focus on women. Variables studied included characteristics of members, length of membership (LM), extent of participation in decision making (EPDM), satisfaction of the level of management (SLM), interaction with cooperative officials (ICO), interaction with members (ICM), satisfaction level on interaction (SLI), members taken into consideration (MTC), annual revenue of the cooperative (ARC), share of meetings attended (SMA), Fifty four legally registered SFC were selected purposively based on their current status and their accessibility. Probability proportionate to size (PPS) technique was used to determine the number of producer members to be studied. A total of 314 members and 54 chairpersons of the cooperatives were interviewed using structured questionnaires. Descriptive statistics (mean, percentage and frequency) and econometric model (tobit and logit) were employed for data analysis using Statistical Analytic Software (SAS) ver. 9.2. Results showed that the majority (69.7%) of members in SFC were men. The SFC in this study showed no trend of increasing membership. Members (53.8) participated moderately in decision making, while 38% had a moderate level of satisfaction in the management. There were high levels of interaction as shown by proportions of producer members who interacted with officials (58.8%) and among themselves (60.4). The proportion of members who attended all cooperative meetings was 30.6%. There were no correlations between age of members and length of membership with other variables. EPDM was strongly correlated (P<0.01) with SLM, ICM, SLI, MTC, ARC and SMA but not correlated (P>0.05) with ICO. From the result of this study, majority (68.9%) of respondent members have no intention of increasing the number of sheep per fattening cycle. Poor market linkage and information, feed, cash and space ranked 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th as factor that limit the number of fattening sheep per cycle. Internal factors were mentioned to have a strong influence on the future existence of SFC as compared to external factors. There was a significantly higher (P< 0.05) proportion of women membership in SFC initiated by NGOs and cooperatives that have women in the leadership positions. There was significantly lower (P<0.001) proportions of women in SFC whereby members buy shares at the start-up. The level of literacy had an effect on women's participation in leadership. Women had a higher chance of being leaders in SFC that were women-based, those with higher proportions of female membership, and those with leaders who have undertaken gender-related training courses. Membership in SFC resulted in improved women's access and control over inputs and resources, training and credit, and participation in decision making and management activities. However, their proportion and participation in leadership of SFC is still limited. Therefore, awareness creation and gender inclusive trainings, access to resources and education should be done and improved in order to involve women effectively in cooperative development.","2016","2025-10-17 13:53:55","2025-10-21 19:05:41","2025-10-17 13:53:55","","","","","","","Characterization of sheep fattening cooperatives in Ethiopia","","","","","Bahir Dar University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476535","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\VBGCJEVJ\Ephrem - 2016 - Characterization of sheep fattening cooperatives in Ethiopia Members’ satisfaction and women’s part.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476535","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A single-visitmultiple- subject survey was used to collect data on milk production & marketing systems. A total of 181 milk households were individually interviewed. On-farm feeding trial was conducted on twenty lactating cows of uniform parity and stage of lactation using a Randomized Complete Block Design (5 treatments & 4 replications). Average body weight and initial milk yield of cows were 231.7±36.7 kg & 1.08±0.11 kg/cow/day respectively. The treatment groups included grazing (T1), noug seed cake (T2), adlib urea treated wheat straw (T3), noug seed cake+ adlib urea treated wheat straw (T4) and concentrate comprising 74% maize grain+25% noug seed cake +1% salt (T5). From the survey, rural small-holder, periurban, and urban milk production systems were identified. Milk and butter were found to be marketed mainly through informal marketing systems. Indigenous and Fogera-Friesian crossbreds were the dominant cattle breeds. The major livestock feed resources are natural pasture, crop residues and aftermaths. Trypanosomiasis, pasteurolosis, anthrax and black leg were the major reported cattle diseases. The main problems of milk production & marketing were lack of feed, disease outbreak, lack of improved cattle breeds and distance to marketing points. The on-farm feeding trial result showed a significant difference (P<0.05) between control and supplemented group in terms of increased milk yield, milk-fat and total solids while treatment effects were not-significantly different (p>0.05), for increased milk protein, solids-not-fat and ash contents. The highest and the lowest milk yield per day was recorded for cows fed urea treated wheat straw and the control group, respectively. The intervention diets increased the net profit/cow/day by ETB 3.40 (T2), 6.33 (T3), 3.58 (T4), and 3.84(T5) over the control (T1). In general, despite the untapped milk potential of the district, the existing milk production (mainly extensive) & marketing (mainly informal) systems are found to be interwoven by many constraints. Urea treated wheat straw supplementation improved milk yield, weight gain and economic return. Therefore, further works are needed in areas of milk nutrition, health, product marketing, input delivery and services and scaling up the feeding package developed in this study considering the respective milk production systems to capitalize the market oriented milk industry in the district.","2009-05","2025-10-17 14:06:55","2025-10-21 19:05:40","2025-10-17 14:06:55","","","","","","","","","","","","Bahir Dar University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476532","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\VRDDQ23R\Kebede - 2009 - Characterization of milk production systems, marketing and on-farm evaluation of the effect of feed.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476532","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, three AEZs within Amhara region made a total of 12 study areas, each with about 36 respondents who were selected purposively, based on the relevant activity and accessibility to transportation. The collected data from the questionnaire was analyzed based on software, SPSS. The result of the region showed that the sheep fattening practice in general, in different AEZs, was found relatively more defined in the highlands, than in the mid lands and the low lands, respectively. Better market demand, shorter distance to health center, qualitatively and quantitatively feed resources availability, higher net profit gain, relatively better market value chain were scored in the highlands than the rest, followed by mid land and the least score in low lands. The high temperatures in the lowlands influenced health problem which ultimately resulted in low production. Even so, the fattening production system is semi- intensive even in better scoring areas and declines to extensive in most cases. But in fulfilling the constraints of each AEZ would enable them to have optimum and relatively, similar production potential. Besides, using appropriate breeds, market chains, distribution of industrial by-products and promotion of loans supported with agricultural inputs would encourage the small holder farmers to engage in sheep fattening, consistently. Tigray Region The purpose of the study was to characterize sheep fattening production system at small holder level in rural areas of Ethiopia, based on different agro-ecological zones (AEZs). 108 small holder sheep fatteners were selected by random sampling out of Tigray region, in three AEZs, each having three kebeles with a total of 12 study areas. In every kebele, 12 respondents were selected using purposive sampling. The collected data from 180 questionnaires was analyzed using SPSS. The mean family size of households in the highlands midland and lowlands were 5.25, 6.36 and 5.42, respectively. Only 11.1% of the respondents in the highlands, 16.7% in the midlands and 30.6% in the lowlands engage in non-agricultural activities. Results from the region showed that there was significantly (p< 0.05) better fattening experience in the highlands compared to other AEZs. However, net profit gain was significantly (p< 0.05) higher in the lowlands. Midlands were significantly (p<0.05) higher in family size.

"ZVN88HLR","thesis","2007","Mengsitie, T. D.","Characterization of cattle milk and meat production, processing and marketing system in Metema District, Ethiopia","","","","","https://hdl.handle.net/10568/709","A study on characterization of cattle milk and meat production, processing and marketing system was conducted in Metema district based on data collected between September and October, 2006. A multistage sampling procedure was employed to select representative kebles and households from CBFS, SBFS and Gendawuha town. A total of 270 households were randomly selected using systematic random sampling method. Questionaire based formal survey as well as PRA techniques were employed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on cattle milk and meat production and processing systems in the district, while RMA techniques were used to characterize the marketing system of dairy products, meat and live cattle. In addition, 30 households were voluntarily selected from the two rural farming systems and were continually monitored to collect quantitative data on milk and other dairy products produced per household. Accordingly, the latter data were used to corroborate the survey based information on related parameters. Two types of livestock production systems were identified in the district, namely crop-livestock mixed farming, which is exercised by resident farmers, and transhumance production system practiced by seasonally in fluxing farmers from neighboring highlands. The current study was concerned entirely on the former production system type. The average cattle herd size of households was 15.53 heads, but it varied significantly (P<0.05) among the three areas. Cows (30.45%) and calves (32.29%) mainly dominate the herd composition, while heifers (13.90%), oxen (12.02%) and bullocks (10.30%) represented minor proportions. Cattle type (Zebu) locally called Agew, Simada and Fogera were dominantly found in the district, although some cattle types introduced from neighboring countries known as “Ruthana” and “Felata” cattle were observed in minor proportions. Where as introduced temperate breeds were entirely lacking in the district. The breeding system was entirely natural mating. 65.8% of the interviewed farmers practiced selective mating, while the rest one-third left their cows for open mating with no concern for selecting the best bull, although some variation exist from area to area. Major feed resources used by the households were natural grazing (31.0%), crop residues (29.5%), crop aftermath (21.8%) and hay (17.8%). The available vast communal range lands provide high potential for conserving excess fodder during the wet season in the form of hay. Despite this, households make insignificant quantity of hay and face critical feed shortage during the dry season. Critical shortage of water was also noted during the dry season, particularly in highly arid lowlands. Three types of diseases were identified as the major health problem of cattle and these included tick infestation (37.2%), babesiosis (31.6%) and FMD (15.6%). Average milk off-take of indigenous cows was 1.90.045 liter/cow/day and on average cows gave a lactation yield of 324.010.274 liters/cow during an average lactation period of about 5.90.14 months. Cows in Gendawuha town gave significantly higher daily milk yield as well as were milked for longer lactation period than in the two rural areas. As a result, the lactation yield xix was significantly higher in the former than in the latter areas and these differences were mainly attributed to better feeding (supplementation) and management provided for the cows in the town. Overall, mean CI was 17.970.313 months, but it was significantly higher in the town than in the rural areas because of extended lactation. Mean AFC of cows in Metema was quite late (4.540.05 years) even by local standard. Out of the total milk produced, most of it was processed (63%), while some quantity was consumed with in the household (18%) and used for calf rearing (13%). On the other hand, most of the butter was consumed with in the household (58 %), while small proportion was sold out (25%). In general, the market share of whole milk and other milk derivatives (cottage cheese, butter milk and fermented milk) was almost negligible, while butter was comparatively the most marketable commodity in all the three areas. The dairy marketing system identified in the study area was entirely informal marketing system. Churning methods includes churning by placing the churner on the floor, hanging the churner on tripods and churner is shacked with both hands. Cattle fattening experience was not developed well, because of lack of experience (34.9%), shortage of labor (30.8%), feed shortage during dry season (17.5%) and shortage of capital (15.9%). Out of the total fresh meat produced, 49.8 % was consumed by the household in the form of fresh, while 50.2% was retained for processing. Milk and meat production and marketing system were constrained by theft of cattle, infectious and parasitic disease, lack of milk processing services, poor market information on the price and supply condition, lack of services (extension, inputs, and veterinary) and lack of feed processing and utilization management. Extension intervention should focus on dairy and meat production and processing as well as on improving the marketing system of these products.","2007-06","2025-10-17 14:09:54","2025-10-21 19:05:39","2025-10-17 14:09:54","","","","","","","","","","","","Hawassa University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476530","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\XBBJWXTB\Mengsitie - 2007 - Characterization of cattle milk and meat production, processing and marketing system in Metema Distr.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476530","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use a randomized controlled trial to test the impact of CCTs on various measures of trust and informal safety nets within communities in Tanzania. We find evidence that the introduction of a CCT program increased program beneficiaries’ trust in other community members and their perceived ability to access support from other households (e.g., childcare). Although CCTs reduced the total size of transfers to beneficiary households in the community in the short run (after 1.75 years of transfers), that reduction had disappeared 2.75 years after transfers began. Taken together, our evidence suggests that formal CCT programs do not necessarily crowd out informal safety nets in the longer term, and they may in fact boost trust and support across households. 2020 Abstract: Cash transfer programs enter communities with existing informal safety nets that function through inter-household transfers. Formal transfers may reduce inter-household transfers by reducing needs, or perceived needs, among the vulnerable households, or they may increase inter-household transfers by giving more liquidity to poor households to provide transfers in response to idiosyncratic shocks experienced by other households in the community. If inter-household transfers affect trust levels within the community, then introducing a cash transfer program could affect community trust. We use a randomized controlled trial to test the impact of cash transfers on various measures of trust and informal safety nets within communities in Tanzania. We find evidence that the introduction of a cash transfer program increased trust as well as certain types of assistance across households (e.g., childcare). Although cash transfers reduced transfers from non-beneficiary households in the community to beneficiary households in the short run (after 1.75 years of transfers), those effects had disappeared by an endline survey conducted 2.75 years after transfers began. Taken together, our evidence suggests that formal cash transfer programs do not necessarily crowd out informal safety nets, and they may in fact boost trust and support across households.","2022-11-10","2025-10-17 13:57:45","2025-10-21 19:05:35","2025-10-17 13:57:45","","","","","","","Cash Transfers, Trust, and Inter-household Transfers","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476514  Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\97JG6DME\Evans and Kosec - 2022 - Cash Transfers, Trust, and Inter-household Transfers Experimental Evidence from Tanzania.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476514","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A rigorous review of programme impact and of  the role of design and implementation features","","","","","","Objectives of the review Cash transfers have been increasingly adopted by low- and middle-income countries as central elements of their poverty reduction and social protection strategies (Barrientos, 2013; DFID, 2011; Hanlon et al., 2010; Honorati et al., 2015; ILO, 2014). There are some 130 low- and middle-income countries that have at least one non-contributory unconditional cash transfer (UCT) programme (including poverty-targeted transfers and old-age social pensions), with growth in programme adoption especially high in Africa, where 40 countries out of 48 in sub-Saharan Africa now have a UCT, double the 2010 total. Similarly, 63 countries have at least one conditional cash transfer programme, up from two countries in 1997 and 27 countries in 2008 (Honorati et al., 2015). This expansion has been accompanied by a growing number of evaluations, resulting in a body of evidence on the effects of different programmes on individual- and household-level outcomes. More recently, closer attention has been paid to the programme design and implementation details that influence the ways in which cash transfers work. This review retrieves, assesses and synthesises the evidence on the effects of cash transfers on individuals and households through a rigorous review of the literature of 15 years, from 2000 to 2015. Focusing on non-contributory monetary transfers, including conditional and unconditional cash transfers, social pensions and enterprise grants, it addresses three overarching research questions: 1. What is the evidence of the impact of cash transfers on a range of individual- or householdlevel outcomes, including intended and unintended outcomes? 2. What is the evidence of the links between variations in programme design and implementation features and cash transfer outcomes? 3. What is the evidence of the impacts of cash transfers, and of variations in their design and implementation components, on women and girls? This review is distinct from previous cash transfer literature reviews in three key features: the methods used (more on this below), the breadth of the evidence retrieved, assessed and synthesised, and the particular focus on programme design and implementation features. The six outcomes covered by the review are: monetary poverty; education; health and nutrition; savings, investment and production; employment; and empowerment. The cash transfer design and implementation features considered are: core design features; conditionality; targeting; payment systems, grievance mechanisms and programme governance; complementary interventions and supply-side services.","2016","2025-10-16 22:43:29","2025-10-21 19:05:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476515","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\9ZCWFR86\Bastagli et al. - Cash transfers what does the evidence say.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476515","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Y.","Carbon stock potentials of woodlands and land use and land cover changes in north western lowlands of Ethiopia","","","","","https://hdl.handle.net/10568/25151","A major problem being faced by human society is the rising of global temperature mainly due to human activity that emit carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The problem of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide can be addressed in a number of ways. One of such actions is forestry development and forest management undertakings. Sustainable forest management and development is believed to be an asset for increasing societal adaptive capacity to climate anomalies. This paper examined the potential of the dry western woodlands of Ethiopia for carbon sequestration in response to woodland cover changes. The study was based on the assumption that increasing societal adaptive capacity is possible through asset building from financial earnings obtained from carbon trading and non-timber forest products, especially gum and resin from Boswellia papyrifera woodland. GIS and RS were used to determine the LULCC. To estimate the amount of carbon stocked in dry land forests; vegetation inventory including dead wood, litter and herbaceous biomass collection were conducted in the 36 sample plots across the three districts of the study area namely: Kafta-Humera 17 plot, Metema 9 plot and Sherkole 10 plot. The sample plots were taken in transects line method in the two categories of woodlands, untapped and tapped Boswellia papyrifera. A total of 24 species were recorded. The soil samples were taken from 0-30 cm soil depth to determine the potential of soil carbon sequestration. To analyze the total woodland carbon stock, allometry equations were used to determine the aboveground, belowground and dead woods biomasses; litter and herbaceous biomasses were determined using direct harvesting method; and the SOC was estimated using standard methods. The result showed, the estimated mean carbon stocks of the aboveground, belowground and the dead wood biomasses for the UW in the Lemlem Terara site were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the Adi Goshu site. In the Gemed site, the mean HBC stock was 1.2 Mg ha-1, which is significantly highest (P=0.0207) than the other two study sites (Lemlem Terara, 0.42 Mg ha-1 and Adi Goshu, 0.45 Mg ha-1) for the TW. In UW, the mean soil carbon stock of the Lemlem Terara site (58.19 Mg ha-1) was significantly (P=0.0019) higher than that of Adi Goshu (33.61 Mg ha-1). However, no statistical variation (P=0.8884) was observed between the mean soil carbon stocks across sites in the tapped stratum. In the case of the total carbon stocks in UW stratum, for the Adi-Goshu site the carbon stock was estimated to be about 55.26 Mg ha-1 while 96.74 Mg ha-1 for Lemlem Terara. In the TW stratum, however, the total carbon of Adi-Goshu, Lemlem-Terara and Gemed sites were 65.93, 68.77 and 71.01 Mg ha-1 respectively. The results of LULCC analysis showed that in all study sites the classes of agricultural and bare land have been increased at an average rate of 2,322.94 and 726.58 ha/year, respectively; while the woodland coverage in the three district was decreasing at an average rate of 2,833.77 ha/year during the last 25 years (1985-2010). The woodland coverage was converted mainly to agriculture at an average rate of 2,057.9 ha/year. Despite the rapid decline in the woodland coverage, the existing wood land has a huge potential for carbon sequestration, which calls for the promotion of sustainable woodland management in this climate sensitive areas. From the view of points of woodland management in a sustainable manner, the study suggested that the NGPME and the regional government should made fundamental thinking in the policy of woodland management in such a way of promoting carbon trading for additional financial incentive to the local community who are depending on the woodland resource. The data obtained from the current study can be used as a baseline data set of carbon stock to make inferences about the carbon stocking in the areas where the study was conducted.","2012-10","2025-10-17 14:08:39","2025-10-21 19:05:34","2025-10-17 14:08:39","","","","","","","","","","","","Hawassa University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476511","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\FCZEDA6Y\Alemu - 2012 - Carbon stock potentials of woodlands and land use and land cover changes in north western lowlands o.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476511","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As part of its commitment to strengthening human capital and advancing climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and climate information services (CIS), the Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project supported ten post-graduate researchers to conduct applied field research in Mali between January and June 2025. The research covered ten priority themes, including the integration of CSA technologies and CIS, gender-responsive innovations such as GEM parboiling, diversification with vegetables and tubers, water and nutrient management, rice-fish systems, innovation platforms, and climate suitability assessments. Findings demonstrated that combined adoption of CSA and CIS significantly improved rice yields, farm incomes, water productivity, food consumption scores, and adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers. Studies also highlighted key enablers for adoption, such as access to training, digital platforms for delivering geo-specific CIS, and inclusive innovation platforms that foster multi-stakeholder collaboration. The program not only generated critical evidence to inform policy and scaling strategies but also strengthened the technical, analytical, and leadership capacities of a new cadre of early-career scientists. The results underscore the importance of integrated approaches that combine technological, institutional, and social innovations to enhance resilience, productivity, and inclusiveness in rice-based systems under climate change. The report concludes with policy recommendations to support sustained scaling of CSA and CIS innovations while strengthening national research capacities in Mali and beyond.","2025-06","2025-10-17 13:53:38","2025-10-21 19:05:34","2025-10-17 13:53:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476509  Publisher: Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\IXVAXWYI\Diallo et al. - 2025 - Capacity strengthening of Post Graduates in climate smart agricutlure and climate information servic.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476509","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To that end, strengthening capacities of the GPs and linking them to development deserve due policy attention. No panacea exists, however, as to how the programs can be better strengthened, linked, and become more responsive. Lessons from initiatives on the ground in the country and beyond are thus crucial to inform policy and the development of context specific innovative strategies. This paper aims to make a modest contribution to the discourse in Ethiopia and beyond on transforming GPs related to agriculture into ‘developmental institutions’. The paper highlights the imperatives for knowledge-based transformation of smallholder agriculture in Ethiopia and emerging roles of GPs; discusses key challenges of the GPs to realize their mandates and to meet ever changing expectations. It also presents a case study of an initiative by +aimed at linking GPs through research by students to commodity value chain development and actors, and discusses qualitative and quantitative indicators of outcome in terms of enhanced research and learning experience. The paper draws out some lessons and identifies strategic and practical options, including from the review of good practices elsewhere, that may help to improve learning and research in the GPs. The analysis shows that the GPs are currently facing several challenges, which could not be solved by government or by the programs alone, but rather require multiple linkages and collaborations. The GPs, on the one hand, need to be more proactive in creating linkages and partnering with regional and federal governments, and with development/interventions, and, on the other, actors who are truly committed to sustainability should be more willing to integrate systematically into development programs, as a critical component, partnering with and strengthening capacity of key capacity building national institutions, such as the GPs. Revitalizing the programs calls for holistic approach from an innovation systems perspective, multipronged and multi-level strategies, and long-term commitments.","2012-01-15","2025-10-17 13:39:16","2025-10-21 19:05:33","2025-10-17 13:39:16","","","","","","","Capacity for knowledge-based smallholder agriculture in Ethiopia","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476507  Publisher: International Livestock Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\YMIXZDEB\Lemma et al. - 2012 - Capacity for knowledge-based smallholder agriculture in Ethiopia Linking graduate programs to marke.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476507","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As climate change worsens it compounds systemic inequalities and exacerbates poverty, food insecurity, and injustice, especially for women and girls. Governments must adopt an integrated approach to addressing the climate crisis, with an intentional focus on building resilience for women living in poverty. Climate change poses unprecedented and growing threats to sustainable development. Globally, 2011-2020 has been the warmest decade on record with resulting shocks such as drought, heat waves, and flooding increasing. At least 85 percent of the global population has been impacted by climate change, and nearly half the world’s population is estimated to be highly vulnerable to climate change but does not have the means and conditions to adapt. People living in extreme poverty are disproportionately affected by climate change due to their dependence on climate-sensitive sectors for their livelihoods and basic needs. Many people living in extreme poverty also suffer from compounded vulnerabilities, such as inadequate access to savings and social protection services that could help them cope with the impacts of climatic shocks. Climate change and poverty disproportionately affect women. Women are more likely to experience extreme poverty than men and are more likely to be negatively impacted by natural disasters. Many livelihood activities most adversely impacted by climate change – such as fetching water – traditionally tend to be women’s responsibility. Moreover, UN figures indicate that 80 percent of people displaced by climate change are women and girls, and climate shocks reduce women’s life expectancies more than men’s on average. In addition, studies have shown that gender-based violence becomes more prevalent after natural disasters, and that women living in extreme poverty often face discrimination in accessing the resources, education, and tools necessary to bounce back from the economic impacts of climate change. Countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are particularly vulnerable to climate shocks such as water scarcity, rising temperatures, desertification, and population movement. These factors pose a range of harmful effects on land productivity, human health, migration, and gender dynamics. Tunisia will be among the 33 countries most likely to experience water stress or scarcity by 2040, which is expected to most acutely impact populations living in poverty, particularly women and farmers. Policymakers must bolster their societies’ ability to withstand and adapt to climatic stressors by designing solutions that respond to the relationships between climate change, extreme poverty, and gender inequality. Long-term solutions that build the climate resilience of the most vulnerable people are critical; however, many policies and initiatives designed to address environmental issues ignore or actively harm these groups. Women and people living in extreme poverty are often excluded from decision-making about responses to climate change, resulting in solutions that not only overlook their wellbeing, but may even harm the very populations that governments are aiming to protect. According to the 2021 State of Economic Inclusion report by the World Bank, 57 percent of economic inclusion programs include interventions that address climate change as a way of protecting and enhancing the livelihood base of program beneficiaries, such as through climate-smart agriculture, water management, and forest protection activities.","2021","2025-10-17 16:58:08","2025-10-21 19:05:30","2025-10-16 22:55:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476494","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\NHSXQM9N\IFAD-Policy-Brief-final.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476494","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Improvements in agricultural policy analysis capacity can therefore significantly benefit society. This report synthesizes lessons learned from the Food Security Policy Innovation Lab’s capacity strengthening efforts over the 2013–2018 period and from related capacity development initiatives conducted over the last four decades by the partner institutions in Africa and Asia. “Capacity” is defined as the resources required for people and institutions to reach their objectives and achieve results in an efficient and sustainable manner. Capacity development is therefore the process of enhancing, improving, and unleashing such resources—in people, organizations, and systems. In this report, the term “locally led” refers to institutions registered in the host country, led by nationals of the host country, and often, but not necessarily, affiliated with a public university or government unit in the host country. Why is the development of locally led agricultural policy analysis important? In principle, governments in developing countries could continue to receive policy analysis guidance from external research organizations, yet governments in most medium- and high-income countries rely on policy guidance from locally led research groups in their own countries. One lesson from capacity development initiatives is that governments are more likely to seriously listen to and engage with policy guidance provided by research units led by well-respected researchers in their own countries, who know the country, the culture, and the local politics surrounding agricultural policy issues. The impact of technical analysis and policy guidance cannot be divorced from policymakers’ trust and respect for the person/group providing it. For these reasons, well-functioning locally led policy analysis units play a crucial role in an effective policy environment, and they can raise the probability that policy analysis will contribute to policy impact. These points in no way downplay the importance of international research units—in fact, they must often play a crucial support role to raise the capacities of locally led policy analysis units to improve the quality of policy decisions in their countries.","2019-12-31","2025-10-17 14:09:05","2025-10-21 19:05:30","2025-10-17 14:09:05","","","","","","","Building locally led agricultural policy analysis capacity","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476495  Publisher: Michigan State University","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\V9XQ4X32\Jayne et al. - 2019 - Building locally led agricultural policy analysis capacity Lessons from experience in developing co.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476495","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although investments in social protection programs are often motivated by equity concerns, they can also contribute to economic growth by, for example, encouraging savings, creating community assets, and addressing market imperfections. Despite their potential and proliferation, not enough is known about social protection programs in Africa.

"EZ6886LZ","journalArticle","2021","Coates, Lindsay; MacMillan, Scott","Breaking Out of the Poverty Trap","","","","","","T his chapter seeks to advance an understanding of the microeconomic and psychological reality of what it means to be ultra- poor, while pointing to an emerging set of scalable, science- based solutions that can break the trap. “The poor” are not a homogenous group, and even the term “extreme poor” is often used to lump together people facing very different circumstances. Using the graduation approach pioneered by BRAC as one example, this chapter will highlight ways to tackle ultra- poverty through the emerging “science of hope,” which posits that when coupled with skills and material support, an injection of well- founded hope and optimism into the lives of the ultra- poor can break the poverty trap. A growing body of evidence suggests that programs activating people’s sense of self- worth lead to improvements in employment, earnings, mental health, political awareness, and women’s influence in the household. There is also growing evidence to suggest that when it comes to ultra- poverty, purely economic boosts, including relatively quick fixes such as unconditional cash transfers or universal basic income, can fail to break the trap, while more holistic changes make the crucial difference.","2021","2025-10-16 22:59:18","2025-10-21 19:05:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476490","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\CCCMPPNX\Coates and MacMillan - Breaking Out of the Poverty Trap.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476490","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second phase of the Strengthen PSNP Institutions and Resilience (SPIR) Resilience Food Security Activity (RFSA) aims to enhance livelihoods, increase resilience to shocks, and improve food security and nutrition for rural households vulnerable to food insecurity in Ethiopia. The RFSA is situated within Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), one of the largest safety net programs in Africa. Funded by USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), SPIR II is implemented by World Vision International (lead), CARE, and ORDA in the Amhara and Oromia regions of Ethiopia. The IMPEL SPIR II impact evaluation employs an experimental design with three arms, comparing two treatment combinations of livelihood and nutrition graduation model programming provided to PSNP beneficiaries relative to a control group receiving only PSNP transfers. The treatment assignment is randomized at kebele level in 234 kebeles. In the first arm (the control group), PSNP is implemented by the government with SPIR II support for the provision of cash and food transfers only (no supplemental programming). In the second arm, SPIR II programming is rolled out to PSNP beneficiary households in conjunction with nurturing care groups (NCGs) targeting enhanced infant and young child nutritional practices. In the third arm, PSNP beneficiary households receive SPIR II programming and NCGs, supplemented with additional targeted cash grants to pregnant and lactating women.","2023-03-01","2025-10-17 13:45:54","2025-10-21 19:05:28","2025-10-17 13:45:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476486  Publisher: The Implementer-Led Evaluation & Learning Associate Award","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\9NF44TFJ\Gilligan et al. - 2023 - Baseline survey report of the Strengthen PSNP Institutions and Resilience phase II (SPIR II) resilie.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476486","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dependence on this type of funding—which by nature is volatile and ad hoc—makes the country somewhat vulnerable to funding shocks. Bolivia’s agricultural research spending has not kept pace with growth in agricultural output. The country’s agricultural research intensity ratio—that is agricultural research spending as a percentage of agricultural GDP—halved from 1.0 to 0.5 percent during 2015–2020. Bolivia’s agricultural research investment is too low to effectively address farm productivity challenges of the rural poor and threats posed by climate change. Compared with most countries in South America, Bolivian agricultural R&D agencies employ relatively few researchers with PhD degrees. In addition, a considerable portion of the most highly qualified researchers are set to retire in the coming decade.

The work has two components namely assessing onion production practices in Sufankara, Guramba and Debir zuria kebeles and evaluating the effects of N: P2O5:S, fertilizer rates on yield and yield components of onion in Jenda kebele. The study was conducted during 2014/15 under irrigation. To assess onion production practices data was collected from 30 onion producing households using semi-structured questioners, focus group discussions, data on demographic structure and the whole value chain of onion production system were recorded and analyzed using SPSS version 20. In the experimental part twelve different N: P2O5:S fertilizer rates were tested. The experiment was laid down in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Data on vegetative and yield parameters were collected and analyzed using SAS version 9.0 computer soft ware. The survey result indicated that most of the onion producers in the study area did not implemented the recommended irrigation cultural practices of onion, Limited supply of improved onion seeds also one of the important factor that contributes to low productivities of onion in the study area. Low rates of fertilizers application, low population of onion plants per unit area, high incidence of disease and insect pests, shortage of pesticides and their adulteration characterize the onion production system under farmer’s practice. As a result the productivity of onion under farmers was low (85.6q/ha) compared with the national production (101q/ha). Besides the average crop water productivity was (1.74 kg/m3) which were relatively low with compared to other researches on onion crop water productivity (4.62 kg/m3)). Although the quantity of water is similar with the requirement of onion (4,914 m3/ha), but the yield obtained is low. The major constraints of onion production in the study area were shortage of irrigation water, high costs of irrigation equipments, shortage of genuine spare parts and accessories, shortage of pesticides and their adulteration, limited supply of improved onion seeds and lack of storage facilities, lack of skills and knowledge, high incidence of diseases and insect pests and weak extension and credit services. Results of N: P2O5:S, rate trial revealed that most of growth and yield parameters of onion were significantly influenced by N: P2O5:S fertilizer rates. The highest plant height (60.1 cm), leaf length (50.1cm) and maturity days (142 days) were recorded in 73.5:92:16.95, 136.5:119.6:22 and 136.5:119.6:22 kg ha-1 N: P2O5: S, application rates respectively. The highest bulb weight (198.8g), marketable yield (20.8t/ha), non marketable yields (0.509 t/ha) and total bulb yield (21.398t/ha) were recorded offer 105:119.6:22 kg ha-1 N:P2O5:S application rate . Onion plants without N: P2O5:S, fertilizer applications were inferior in all growth and yield parameters. For enhancement of production and productivity of onion in Dembyia district and other similar environment, it is necessary to solve problems indicated above through training, extension activities and improving the supply of inputs. Application of N: P2O5:S fertilizer at the rate of 105:119.6:22 N:P2O5:S kg ha-1 was economically feasible and thus can be recommended for the production of onion in the study area.

Traditional, semi-intensive and intensive beef cattle production and marketing system were considered for the study. For this purpose 120 respondents were included based on discussions with district livestock experts, 1 kebele for intensive; 2 kebeles from semi-intensive fattening systems were purposively selected as they are the only kebeles practicing intensive and semi-intensive fattening in the district. From the traditional system, three kebeles were randomly selected. Structured and semi-structured questioners were used to collect data from sampled households. In addition the performance of beef animals and chemical composition of major feedstuff were evaluated on eleven purposively selected feedlots and households (2 intensive feed lots, 3 semi-intensive and 6 from traditional). Major feed resources used from the 11 households involved in body weight monitoring were collected and chemical composition determined. From the interviewed households, 100%, 85%, 75%, 63%, and 55% of them use crop residues, aftermath grazing, grazing from communal, roadside and riverside areas, respectively. The majority of the respondents (82.5%) provided additional supplement for their cattle during dry season. Traditional fatteners commonly used noug cake (72.2%) and local brewery by-product (70%) as the main sources of feed. During wet season the major feed resources was grazing (76.3%) while during the dry seasons, tethering (49.1%, free grazing (41.6%) and cut and carry system (1.6%) were the main feed resources. The majority (82.5%) of the farmers supplement cattle during dry season which was provided once a day (44.2%), twice a day (21.7%) and whenever available (34.2%).Traditional fatteners mainly use their own animal for fattening from their herds. The semi-intensive and intensive fatteners purchase fattening animals from another source. The most preferred animal for fattening was old oxen (56.7%) in the traditional fattening system while young bull (20.8%) was used in semi- commercial and intensive fatteners. Cattle were fattened once, twice and trice a year under traditional, semi-intensive, intensive production systems, respectively. In all production systems, decision of ending fattening period was made based on live weight change. The average length of fattening period was 3-4, 3, 3 months for traditional, semi-intensive and intensive system, respectively. At the market places, the main buyers of beef cattle were local traders (74.2%) in traditional and semi-intensive systems. According to the respondents, reasons for prices variation were involvement of number of traders (75.8%), road and transportation accessibility (15%) and proximity to urban (9.2%) places. The determinants of price of animals (purchased/sold) were breed (29.2%), weight (28.3%), and color (26.7%) and age (15%). The majority of the producers (95.4%) in traditional fattening system and semixviii intensive fatteners (100%) sold their fattened cattle in eye ball estimation at market place, while fatteners in intensive system used live weight to sell their cattle. The majority of the respondents (55%) relay on the information they get from brokers. More than three-fourth of the fatteners in all production systems sell their fattened beef (100%) during holidays. The crude protein content of the feedstuff ranged from 3.79 to 29%. The average daily gain increased (P<0.01) with increasing levels of intensification which was 0.4 kg, 0.53 kg, 0.91 kg for traditional, semi-intensive and 0.91 kg, respectively. The weight gain for intensive fattening was significantly higher than the other two systems. Major constraints that hindered the performance of cattle fattening activity were feed and water shortages, marketing and disease problems. In conclusion, in order to improve the performance of beef cattle, especially under traditional production system, there is a need to supply adequate feed in terms of quality and quantity which could promote the frequency of fattening. Appropriate marketing system should be developed so that farmers can benefit from their business. ====","2016-06-30","2025-10-17 14:12:22","2025-10-21 19:05:25","2025-10-17 14:12:22","","","","","","","","","","","","Hawassa University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476476","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\PQ5BCBF2\Moreda - 2016 - Assessment of beef cattle production, management practices and marketing system in Lume District of.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476476","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Real food prices remain well above the levels of the 1980s and 1990s, slowing progress on poverty reduction (FAO food price index). Crises due to conflict and adverse weather in 2017 put 815 million people at risk of hunger (IFPRI’s 2018 Global Food Policy Report), reversing the prior downward trend, and straining social protection and emergency relief programs. Tensions that surfaced in the international trading system seeded steps toward protectionism in agricultural markets, with negative implications for growth and food security. The US withdrawal from global commitments on climate change and reversal of regulations for environmental protection will slow attainment of global objectives. Young migrants flowing into Europe from countries with lagging job creation triggered renewed attention to agriculture’s contributions to job security as well as food security. Slow progress toward gender equality in developing countries led to increased emphasis on gender research in key development agencies and foundations in 2017. These critical issues are all germane to CGIAR’s System Level Outcomes (SLOs), and research on them from PIM’s six flagships informs the global discourse and provides diagnostic and evaluative evidence to decision makers (see Table A-1 for evidence of PIM’s contributions to the SLOs).","2018-08-01","2025-10-17 14:27:45","2025-10-21 19:05:24","2025-10-17 14:27:45","","","","","","","Annual report 2017","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476472  Publisher: CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\MCZKW8YV\CGIAR Research Program on Policies - 2018 - Annual report 2017 CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476472","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Irrigated vegetable production is increasing with population growth and changes in consumption habits in Ethiopia creating business opportunity for many actors along the market chain, despite number of production and marketing constraints. Analysis of marketing performance of vegetable plays an important role in an ongoing or future market development plan. This study aimed at analyzing the market chain of vegetable for Dugda Woreda with the specific objectives of: identifying the key vegetable marketing actors and channels; examining market structure of major actors; assessing the market performance for key vegetable marketing actors and channels by quantifying costs and profit margins; and identifying key production and marketing constraints and opportunities faced by smallholders. The data was generated by household survey using a pre-tested structured questionnaire, key informant interview, focus group discussions, semi structured questionnaires and checklists. This was supplemented by secondary data collected from different published and unpublished sources. The data analyzed using SPSS version 20 and summarized into descriptive formats such as frequencies, percentages, means and standard deviation. Besides, Structure, Conduct and Performance (SCP) model employed to evaluate the structure and performance of vegetable market. The study finding shows that vegetable market chain actors are broadly classified into three: input suppliers; direct market actors (producers, brokers, farmer traders, wholesalers, retailers and consumers); and enablers (extension service providers & credit providers). Vegetable producers sell their products to different market intermediaries and final consumers. About five vegetable marketing channels were identified. The total amount of vegetable that was transacted through these marketing channels in 2014/15 was 32,010 quintals. Channel II was found to be the dominant marketing channel in terms of volume of vegetable supply, where about 23,752 quintals of vegetable (74.2% of the total vegetable) was supplied to the market. Channel III was the second dominant market supplier, where about 6,786 quintals of vegetable (21.2%) supplied through this channel. The study result also shows that the total gross marketing margin was 30% with producer participation margin of 70%. The market intermediaries incurred different marketing costs such as packing, sorting, transportation, loading and unloading. Central wholesalers obtain relatively highest profit in channel II and III, which amounted to Birr 204,827 and 58,675, respectively. The study result signifies that the first four largest volumes of vegetable purchased by traders (CR4) constitute 50% of market share, which indicates the market structure for vegetable is strongly oligopolistic. OLS regression results also revealed that there are economies of scale for wholesalers at Meki market, which clearly indicates the presence of barrier to entry/exit for wholesalers in the market. Opportunities identified for vegetable production include: existence of groundwater, convenient agro-ecology and ideally appropriate for agro-processing industries. On the other hand, challenges recognized for vegetable market chain includes: oligopolistic market structure, absence of storage facilities, soil salinity, overutilization of inputs (fertilizers), increasing cost of inputs, lack of improved seeds and chemicals (insecticides and fungicides), price fluctuation, and high market involvement of brokers. Policy implications drawn from the study findings necessitate legalizing and supporting actors in the local vegetable markets, creating access to accurate and regular market information and technical support to producers on crop diversification.","2015-06-30","2025-10-17 14:07:40","2025-10-21 19:05:23","2025-10-17 14:07:40","","","","","","","","","","","","Addis Ababa University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476469","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\BRB3DGNL\Setegn - 2015 - Analysis of vegetable market chain in Dugda Woreda, east Shoa Zone, Oromia Region, Ethiopia.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476469","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Md; Garrett, J.; Joshi, Deepa; Wickramasinghe, Nipuna","An assessment of Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) in the governance, policies and programs of Bangladesh’s agri-food systems","","","","","https://hdl.handle.net/10568/139495","Agri-food system policies and programs in Bangladesh increasingly consider environmental challenges and intersections. Social and political dimensions of agri-food systems are of equal importance to sustainable food security. Is similar attention paid to these issues? The impacts of climate change and challenges from environmental pollution and degradation of natural resources have been shown to lead to declines in agricultural productivity, while at the same time further impacting sustainability and ecosystem services. These challenges can worsen food insecurity in Bangladesh. Inattention to these issues in policies, programs and fiscal strategies will not only affect those who are the most marginalized but also undermine Bangladesh’s social and economic development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The focus of this study was to examine agri-food system governance in Bangladesh considering seven dimensions of inclusive governance: representation, participation, capacity and skills, access to resources, financial resources, knowledge and innovation. Examining 23 key policies and programs, this report aims to address the following questions: 1. Is socially inclusive governance a focus of key agri-food system policies and programs? 2. What interventions could enable a shift towards more socially inclusive governance for agri-food systems in Bangladesh? In Bangladesh, agri-food policies and programs do recognize women and other marginalized groups as key stakeholders and encourage some participation of these groups. However, the analysis of 23 relevant food, water, environment and climate policies shows that the focus on issues of inclusive governance lacks coherence, and consequently, the processes of representation and participation are inconsistent. There seems to be a growing effort to engage and consult women and marginalized groups in policy development processes, however, these initiatives are not consistent across policies. Moreover, even when policies and programs are relatively inclusive, little is known of their effectiveness and impact in practice. Policies tend to lack complementary implementation guidelines, and while budgetary allocations for ensuring gender equality are mandatory for all ministries, there is little review, monitoring and reflection on what works well or does not, in terms of socially inclusive governance. Regardless of these challenges, the national Gender Budget Report of Bangladesh prepared annually for all ministries to report on expenditures to promote gender equality across different sectors, including in agri-food system programs, is a key example of the national commitment to tackling gender inequalities through consistent fiscal planning. The study findings show that a key challenge to socially inclusive policies and programs is the lack of granular evidence and knowledge about the diversity of exclusions experienced by marginalized groups. Without proper representation and voice in decision-making, policies designed top-down are often unable to respond to complex ground realities. To promote gender equality and social inclusion, the authors propose the following interventions: • Ensure intentional and consistent attention to socially inclusive governance across relevant policies and sectors, and review and track the representation and participation of marginalized communities in agri-food system policy processes. • Assess how heterogeneity and intersectionality among marginalized groups impact representation and participation in governance across agri-food system value chains, livelihoods and food security, and adaptation and coping strategies in the face of increasing climate and other risks. • Improve awareness of, and capacity and skills related to, gender and social inclusion for institutional actors implementing policies at scale, and also ensure their engagement in agri-food system policymaking. • Ensure that agri-food system governance processes tackle, and do not reinforce social identity stereotypes based on gender, ethnicity and forms of marginalization. • Ensure policies are complemented with detailed strategies and guidelines for implementation, supported by appropriate financing, and that there is a framework and process in place to regularly review and monitor outputs and outcomes.","2023-12-01","2025-10-17 14:28:32","2025-10-21 19:05:22","2025-10-17 14:28:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476465  Publisher: International Water Management Institute (IWMI).

Using longitudinal data from Ethiopia, this study characterized women’s diet over time and evaluated the potential implications of seasonality and irrigation on women’s diet. Women’s dietary diversity was low (3-4 out of 10 food groups) and exhibited high seasonal variability (P<0.05). Diets were predominantly plant-based, with little consumption of nutrientdense foods, such as fruits and animal source foods. High seasonal variability in energy, protein, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and zinc intakes were observed (P<0.01). Irrigators were more likely to meet the minimum dietary diversity for women (MDDW), had higher energy and calcium intake, and lower prevalence of anemia, than women from non-irrigating households (P< 0.05). No cases of malaria were reported from the three rounds of screening. Our preliminary findings suggest that there is high seasonal variation in women’s diet, but this can be partly offset by irrigation practices.","2019","2025-10-17 14:26:38","2025-10-21 19:06:14","2025-10-17 14:26:38","","","","","","","Irrigation and women’s diet in Ethiopia","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476663  Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\2CLPLRPV\Baye et al. - 2019 - Irrigation and women’s diet in Ethiopia A longitudinal study.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476663","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The agricultural sector in Ethiopia is highly climate dependent. More than 95% of farmed land grows crops under rain-fed agriculture. Given continually increasing climate change trends and variability, Ethiopia is expected to get hotter in the foreseeable future. This situation will increase small farm households' vulnerability to climate-related shocks that may induce food insecurity, malnutrition, diet-related non-communicable diseases, and large-scale displacements. Since there is no vaccine for climate change, equipping next-generation agricultural science graduates with the concepts of Climate Information Services (CIS) and Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is one of the best ways to address climate change related challenges and envision knowledge-based innovative practices that strengthen adaptation to climate change and leverage mitigation actions. Climate Change Education (CCE) and trainings have long been recognized by the national CCE strategy (2017-2030), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (Agenda 2030) as key tools to unravel the complex and multi-sectorial challenges induced/posed by climate change. Thus, Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA), in collaboration with Ethiopian Higher Education, initiated the integration of the concept of CIS and CSA in the agricultural program in Ethiopia. Demand was created among Ethiopian public universities by engaging university vice presidents, Professionals from agriculture and climate sciences. Through consultation workshops and discussions with university management, it was noted that integrating climate products as a sub-chapter and case studies in the existing curriculum is one of the strategies to respond to climate change through education. To implement the integration of climate products (CIS, CSA, CRMA and CB) in the existing curricula, a committee was named to collect the agriculture curricula, execute gap analyses and recommend the integration of CP in the existing curriculum. A draft document was produced and circulated among committees, and the comments were received. The gap analyses revealed that there were 11 climate-related courses offered in 10 departments in the Undergraduate program. The courses were either shallowly addressed or do not address climate products in the curricula. This has necessitated integrating the existing curriculum with climate products to contribute to the efforts of climate education, ensuring the relevance and quality of education. A validation workshop was organized, and the findings of the gap analyses and gap-filling recommendations were presented to university representatives drawn from 27 Universities. Comments in the validation workshop were included, and a final integrated curriculum was approved. A document that integrated climate products were produced and passed to the universities, and action points and a timeline was established for implementation. It was recommended that incorporating CP in the curricula be extended to other disciplines (e.g., health, Water Engineering etc.). It was also suggested to extend the experience to PG programs of all disciplines coupled with strong capacity-building efforts for teaching staff. It was also recommended that a standalone, common course and credited courses should be offered to all University students to advance climate education and respond to climate change.","2022-12","2025-10-17 13:46:46","2025-10-21 19:06:14","2025-10-17 13:46:46","","","","","","","Integrating Climate Products in the Existing Undergraduate Curricula","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476660  Publisher: Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\P22ZL72C\Belay et al. - 2022 - Integrating Climate Products in the Existing Undergraduate Curricula An Approach to Respond to Clim.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476660","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We then employed the underlying methods to prepare shadow notifications of India's domestic support for 1998-2005. Following that, we explored alternative support-definition scenarios and their possible effects on shadow notifications. Preliminary support estimates for 2006-2007 and a projection for 2015 are also provided with a discussion on how the latest WTO (2008) draft modalities are likely to impact India's domestic support. India's official notifications began in 1995 with green box support of nearly US$2 billion and limited use of special and differential treatment. The product-specific aggregate measure of support (AMS) was negative because external reference prices were larger than minimum support prices. Nonproduct-specific AMS, by way of fertilizer, electricity, irrigation, credit, and seed subsidies, accounted for about 7 percent of the value of agricultural production in 1995. In subsequent notifications, for 1996 and 1997, several key changes were observed. The first was the transfer of 80 percent of fertilizer, irrigation, and electricity subsidies from nonproduct-specific AMS to special and differential treatment of low-income and resource-poor farmers. Product-specific AMS remained negative, but the value of production was replaced by eligible production, which was set equal to quantities procured by public agencies in 1996 and 1997. Shadow notifications, based on our understanding of the underlying methods, showed that green box support had grown to nearly US$8.0 billion in 2005. Estimates of input subsidies to low-income and resource-poor producers declined between 1998 and 2002, but they amounted to about US$4.5 billion or 4 percent of the value of agricultural production in 2005. Product-specific AMS remained negative through 2005 mostly because of the wide gap between external reference prices and minimum support prices. Nonproduct-specific AMS accounted for about 1 percent of the annual value of agricultural production for 1998-2005. Alternative support-definition and measurement scenarios showed a possible increase in product-specific AMS. However, reallocating input subsidies from special and differential treatment to nonproduct-specific AMS would only eliminate some of the slack in the latter's de minimis exemption. With India's general elections expected in early 2009, the immediate future includes popular policies such as credit subsidies and significant growth in minimum support prices. Nevertheless, non-product-specific AMS would not likely exceed the limits proposed in the Doha Round (that is, 10 percent of value of production) even with popular policies. However, product-specific AMS would turn positive, especially in cereals, with high growth in support prices and the appreciation of Rupee as seen in recent years. Projections for 2015 suggest that de minimis exemptions would be about US$16 billion each for product-specific and non-product-specific AMS, giving India ample flexibility in domestic support policies.","2008","2025-10-17 14:12:11","2025-10-30 16:36:29","2025-10-17 14:12:11","","","","","","","India","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752194  Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\UYBTCEQS\Gopinath - 2008 - India Shadow WTO agricultural domestic support notifications.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752194","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, climate change poses a serious risk to the sector. On the other hand, agriculture is a major contributor (i.e., about 55%) of the country’s greenhouse gas emission. To address the strong and bidirectional interrelationships between climate change and agriculture, the agricultural sector needs to transform in a climate-smart way. Climate change education will have paramount importance for tackling the problems associated with climate change through generating climate smart technologies for the enhancement of sustainable agricultural production and biodiversity conservation. Climate Change Educations (CCE) and trainings have long been recognized by the national CCE strategy (2017-2030), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (Agenda 2030) as key tools to unravel the complex and multi-sectoral challenges induced/posed by climate change. Thus, specifically, including the concepts of Climate Information Service (CIS) Climate Risk Management (CRM) and Climate smart agriculture (CSA) in the existing climate related courses is critical to build climate resilient agricultural sector in Ethiopia. Thus, Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) in collaboration with Ethiopian Higher Educations initiated to integrate the concept of CIS and CSA in the agricultural program in Ethiopia. Therefore, this document, explore if there is a gap between climate related course contents and the current CIS, CRM and CSA knowledge and innovations to addresses climate related agricultural challenges in ten undergraduate agricultural curricula of Ethiopian Higher Education Institutes. Ten climate related course descriptions were content analyzed to analyze gaps related to the concepts of CIS, CRM and CSA. The study found that there were gaps between the current curriculum and the desired knowledge and innovation of CIS, CRM and CSA to addresses the current and emerging climate change challenges in the agricultural sector. These results emphasize the need for curriculum review and reform to ensure CIS, CRM and CSA knowledge and innovations equipping the university graduates with comprehensive knowledge of climate change.","2022-09-01","2025-10-17 14:09:42","2025-10-30 16:36:30","2025-10-17 14:09:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752197  Publisher: Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\SBW2IC2V\Dejene et al. - 2022 - Integrating Climate Basics, Climate Information Service, Climate Risk Management and Climate Smart A.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752197","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Farmers use their indigenous knowledge from time immemorial till today, thus it gives a good solution for their problems. However, this knowledge is not well studied, analyzed and documented to be used as a basis for farming system development. Therefore, this study was conducted with the objectives of identifying and documenting farmers’ indigenous knowledge in livestock husbandry, and ethno veterinary practices in Endamohoni district of southern Tigray. The woreda was purposively selected based on its contrasting agro-ecologies (lowland, midland, and highland) and potential of being the source of traditionally knowledgeable peoples who for generations have been associated with livestock rearing. Six kebeles (two kebeles from each of the three agroecologies) were selected as study sites. A total of 175 households (55 from lowland, 60 each from midland and highland), assumed to have a better indigenous knowledge in livestock production were selected for the study. A structured questionnaire was administered to the selected households to collect data on use of indigenous knowledge on livestock husbandry and ethno veterinary practices. After completing the questionnaires for each division, group discussions have been held and an informal meeting with the key informants for triangulation. Result indicated that 88.3, 76.7 and 92.7 % of the respondents in highland, midland and lowland agroecologies respectively were males. The level of education shows that of all the respondents, 55% in highland, 50% in midland and 72.73% in lowland were illiterate. Sheep and cattle in highlands and midlands and goat and cattle in lowland dominated the livestock populations. Shortage of feed in the study areas was ranked as the first constraints of animal production. Farmers use purchasing of crop residue in the highland and midland, destocking in the midland and movement (urna) in the lowland as mitigation mechanisms. Phenotypic selections of different animal species are employed and also keeping history of pedigree is important instrument in the breeding and selection of animals. Breeding of close related livestock is discouraged in the study sites. Seventeen animal diseases and38 aliments were recorded in the study areas and 65 medicinal plants were accordingly documented to treat those diseases. About 83% of the highland, 75 % of the midland and 92.7% of the lowland farmers acquire ethno veterinary knowledge from their old parents. Of the total medicinal plants, (81 %) were wild. In the preparation of the traditional medicine leaves constitute about 51% and 47 % of the medicine was administered orally. The most common preparation method is by crushing and squeezing (45 %). Farmers are aware of toxicity and provide antioxidants. Farmers used herbals (plants) in dairy utensils cleaning, fumigation, milk processing and preservation. These knowledge and practices of livestock husbandry, animal health and product handling and processing should serve as the basis to develop further interventions to improve livestock productivity in the area. As most of the medicinal plants are grown in wild, it is very important to promote conservation in ex-situ and in-situ. And further biological studies should be conducted on the reported medicinal plant species of the study area so as to utilize them in drug development.","2016-01-30","2025-10-17 14:02:55","2025-10-30 16:36:29","2025-10-17 14:02:55","","","","","","","","","","","","Hawassa University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752195","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\PRC7BIK4\Abraha - 2016 - Indigenous livestock husbandry and ethno veterinary practices in Endamohoni District of Tigray Regio.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752195","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beyond its importance for food security and nutrition, small scale aquaculture contributes to the livelihoods of many rural households and is a potentially valuable strategy for rural development. However, small-scale aquaculture producers have limited access to improved production technologies and information, which hampers the productivity and socioeconomic performance of small-scale aquaculture systems. In this study we assessed the impact of the adoption of better management practices and exposure to nutrition-sensitive training by 379 small-scale aquaculture producers in the Sagaing and Shan regions of Myanmar. We focused on whether and how the exposure to these interventions affected household food security through improvements in productivity and livelihoods. We used Propensity Score Matching to compare the performance of groups that were exposed to the intervention for one or two years, for seven impact variables. Exposure to the intervention had a positive effect for most impact variables, with differentiated effects among variables, group comparisons and regions. In terms of food security, beneficiaries had significantly higher dietary diversity (measured as the Food Consumption Score, FCS), but there were no significant differences for fish self-consumption (measured in kg/week). Longer exposure to the interventions produced significantly higher positive effects across most impact variables for the 2-year beneficiaries compared to 1-year beneficiaries and control groups. Our study suggests that the length of exposure to such interventions can be important in mediating the actual impact of small-scale aquaculture systems on household food security and livelihoods. Sustained help to small-scale producers should be considered in initiatives and development projects seeking to enhance the food security and rural development of small-scale aquaculture systems in Myanmar, and beyond.","2024-06","2025-10-17 14:19:01","2025-10-30 16:36:25","2025-10-17 14:19:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752179  Publisher: Springer","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\J2MRSTRW\Brako Dompreh et al. - 2024 - Impact of adoption of better management practices and nutrition-sensitive training on the productivi.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752179","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimate the impact of a nutrition and gender SBCC intervention on women’s dietary diversity and empowerment in Myanmar during an especially challenging period—the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intervention was implemented as a cluster-randomized controlled trial in 30 villages in Myanmar’s Central Dry Zone. Our analysis employs data from the baseline survey implemented in February 2020 and a phone survey implemented in February–March 2021 and focuses on women’s dietary diversity and sub-indicators of the project-level women’s empowerment in agriculture index (pro-WEAI). Two indicators of women’s empowerment―inputs to productive decisions and access to and decisions over credit―improved, indicating that SBCC interventions can contribute to changing gendered perceptions and behaviors; however, most of the empowerment indicators did not change, indicating that much of gendered norms and beliefs take time to change. Women’s dietary diversity scores were higher by half a food group out of 10 in treatment villages. More women in treatment villages consumed nuts, milk, meat or fish, and Vitamin A–rich foods daily than in control villages. We show that even in the setting of a pandemic, a SBCC intervention can be delivered through a range of tools, including household visits, phone-based coaching, and voice-based training, that are responsive to local and individual resource limitations. Gender messaging can change some gendered perceptions; but it may take more time to change deeply ingrained gender norms. Nutrition messaging can help counter the declines in dietary quality that would be expected from negative shocks to supply chains and incomes.","2022-04-18","2025-10-17 13:56:01","2025-10-30 16:36:25","2025-10-17 13:56:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752177  Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\37R7Y6LL\Activity - 2022 - Impact of a gender and nutrition behavioral change communication amid the COVID-19 crisis in Myanmar.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752177","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PSNP provides food or cash transfers targeted to poor households in the form of payments for seasonal labor on public works (PW) or as direct support (DS) to households whose primary income earners are elderly or disabled. With more than 8 million beneficiaries, the PSNP is one of the largest social protection programs in Sub-Saharan Africa. The PNSP has played an important role in improving the lives of poor Ethiopian households by reducing household food insecurity, increasing asset holdings and improving agricultural productivity (Berhane et al. 2014; Hoddinott et al. 2017). The fourth phase of the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP4) began operating in 2016. Under PSNP4, the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) undertook a new round of targeting to identify client households. GOE also added a new objective to the PSNP to improve the nutritional status of women and children by better linking PSNP clients to health and nutrition services and through nutrition conditionalities (World Bank 2014). PNSP4 also included an enhanced livelihood transfer program to strengthen livelihoods and build assets, seeking to improve on the performance past livelihood transfer components of the PSNP.","2019-11-26","2025-10-17 13:45:21","2025-10-21 19:06:10","2025-10-17 13:45:21","","","","","","","Impact evaluation of the strengthen PSNP4 institutions and resilience (SPIR) development food security activity (DFSA)","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476645","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\IR335YUR\Alderman et al. - 2019 - Impact evaluation of the strengthen PSNP4 institutions and resilience (SPIR) development food securi.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476645","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following promising results from initial studies on multiple economic Photo Credit: Peter Lowe / CIMMYT and social outcomes (e.g., Banerjee et al., 2015; Bandiera et al., 2017; Banerjee et al., 2021), these graduation and economic inclusion programs are increasingly being taken up by governments to complement their national social assistance programs.

In our study, we evaluate the impact of the program on the lives of the targeted ultra-poor households in the 2018 program cohort in these two sub-districts, using a quasi-experimental design. We found that the program increased per capita monthly income by about 30 per cent among participating households and also has had positive effects on savings about two years after the program implementation. Estimated effects on food and non-food consumption expenditure are also positive and statistically significant. There is, consequently, a remarkable improvement in the food security situation among the participants.","2020","2025-10-16 23:08:42","2025-10-21 19:06:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476643","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\F9QRVZ3W\Bhattacharjee et al. - Impact Evaluation of BRAC’s Ultra-Poor Graduation Programme for Host Community in Cox’s Bazar.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476643","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"PJNIDUV9","journalArticle","2016","Raza, Wameq A; de Poel, Ellen Van","Impact and Spillover Effects of an Asset Transfer Programme on Malnutrition","","","","","","Evidence shows that ultra-poor households are typically unable to participate in mainstream poverty alleviation programmes. In response, an international NGO called BRAC in Bangladesh implemented the Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction: Targeted Ultra-Poor (CFPR: TUP) programme that explicitly targets those living below $0.60-$0.70/day. The innovative scheme combines the provision of income generating assets with an integrated approach that includes multifaceted training on entrepreneurial activities, health, nutrition, social and political awareness training over a period of two years. A number of papers have established the positive impact of the programme on various socioeconomic indicators of participants and the positive spill overs to non-participants.  This is the first paper to evaluate the effects of CFPR on nutritional outcomes using data from a randomised control trial covering 26997 households and panel data over a four year period. We find large improvements in nutritional outcomes among household members who participate in CFPR. The impact is most notable for children under 5 where the likelihood of wasting reduces by 8 percentage points (pp) and the likelihood of being underweight by 19 pp. Behavioural changes, such as increased duration of exclusive breastfeeding, administration of vitamin A appear to be the primary drivers of nutritional improvements for children; while food security and hygiene practices are important pathways for improvements in adults’ nutritional status. Spill over effects on non-participants are generally half the size of the main effect, and are only found for poor non-participants suggesting that behavioural changes are more likely to be adopted by groups of similar socioeconomic status. Overall, we conclude that asset transfer programmes such as the CFPR can have large positive long term health effects and lead to positive externalities.","2016","2025-10-16 23:02:48","2025-10-21 19:06:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476642","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\Y2IGXFRS\Raza and de Poel - Impact and Spillover Effects of an Asset Transfer Programme on Malnutrition.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476642","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to evaluate growth performance of tree lucerne in terms of survival, root collar diameter (RCD), plant height and biomass yield as influenced by different management. To conduct the present study three highlands districts (woredas) located in southern region (Lemo), in Oromia region (Sinana) and Tigrai region (Endamehoni) were selected. Within each woreda, two kebeles were purposely selected to be used as action sites, and from each kebele a minimum of 25 farmers were selected to participate in tree Lucerne adaptation trials. Each farmer received about 150 seedlings to plant and grow. Data were collected on feed resources, household characteristics and survival and performance of the seedlings. The tree lucerne fodder plots established and performed well were used to collect data on the effect of cutting height, and cutting frequency on the biomass yield of fodder. The fodder plants were subjected to two cutting heights (1m and 1.5m), and three cutting frequencies (2, 3, 4 times per year). The average household family size and livestock holdings were 8.08 heads and 10.35 heads, respectively. According to the result about 66% of the land was used for crop cultivation and the remaining 34% was apportioned into improved forage and other back yard trees in the study area. About 85.4% respondents perceived that the landholding size is decreasing, while about 13% of the farmers said that it remained stable over the years. Grazing (both private and communal) contributed the largest share of the feed resources, followed by crop residues. About 44% of the farmers mentioned that their main reason for engaging in tree lucerne cultivation is to produce livestock feed supplement. The maximum survival rate was observed for plants which grew around backyard on small plot followed by that grown on the contour lines, whereas the lowest survival rate was achieved from plants grown around water logged areas. Transplanting too small seedlings showed lower (p<0.05) survival rate as compared to the remaining agronomic and management practices. Planting space of 100cm between rows and 100cm between plants resulted in significantly (p<0.05) higher dry matter yield than 50x50cm spacing. Tree lucerne showed accelerated growth in terms of height and RCD after six months. Annual biomass production was substantially greater for six months cutting interval than for the more frequent harvests in a range of 4.17 to 8.22 t ha–1. Whereas, the two cutting height not showed significant (p<0.05) differences on biomass yield. Leaf proportion of the biomass yield consistently decreased from 63.55 to 54.52% and the stem increased from 2.38 to 16.54% as the cutting interval prolonged from three to six months, respectively. The crude protein contents for the month of June (28%) was significantly (p<0.05) higher than that of October (24.6%), whereas, the other months had intermediate value. There were no significant (p<0.05) differences in IVOMD and ME contents among the different cutting months. The current study revealed that with proper management practices, tree Lucerne can be a suitable protein supplement for ruminant livestock in the study areas.","2016-06-30","2025-10-17 14:11:03","2025-10-21 19:06:03","2025-10-17 14:11:03","","","","","","","","","","","","Hawassa University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476620","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\TJKZP6D8\Tadesse - 2016 - Growth performance and nutritive quality of tree Lucerne (Chamaecytisus palmensis) fodder under diff.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476620","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This story book comprises five stories which highlight the impact of HER+, reflecting just a small part of the multiple initiatives, partnerships, evidence, tools and impact generated by HER+. More information about these can be found here. The first story, Overcoming structural barriers to gender equality and women’s empowerment in agrifood systems, demonstrates how HER+ is addressing structural barriers in collaboration with national governments, national agricultural research and extension systems (NARES), civil society organizations (CSOs), international and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs), UN agencies, and rural men and women. It summarizes the evidence and new tools, guidelines, practices and partnerships which HER+ has developed to address the structural barriers to gender equality in agrifood systems in many LMICs, including in Bangladesh, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, and Tanzania. This story also highlights the activities of the four work packages (WPs). Co-design addresses restrictive gender norms in agrifood systems is the second story which explains how WP1 TRANSFORM has developed an innovative guide to identify leverage points and levers to address restrictive gender norms. This guide has now been applied to cassava, poultry and fish value chains in Nigeria and Tanzania. Next, Building capacity and resilience of women farmers in India, illustrates how WP2 EMPOWER is working with Indian government NARES institutions, CSOs, NGOs, and rural women and men to pilot gender-responsive socio-technical innovation bundles (STIBs) in learning labs. This approach strengthens women’s resilience and economic empowerment while addressing gender norms that prevent women from transforming their livestock farming to remunerative businesses. The fourth story, Adoption of sustainable land management interventions in Ethiopia, provides a summary of how HER+ WP3 PROTECT has collaborated with World Vision International and others to integrate co-designed sustainable land management interventions within Ethiopia’s social protection programming, reaching women in poor rural households. Finally, Sustainability systems address gender inequality in value chains from WP4 VOICE shows how HER+ has collaborated with ISEAL Alliance, a global membership organization for sustainability systems, to strengthen capacities to integrate gender equality considerations into Voluntary Sustainability Standards and programming. These efforts support ISEAL members, active in 100+ countries worldwide, to advance gender equality.","2024-12","2025-10-17 14:26:50","2025-10-21 19:06:03","2025-10-17 14:26:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476622  Publisher: CGIAR System Organization","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\BNTDWJVT\Equality and Cummings - 2024 - HER+ Gender Equality Impact Story Book.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476622","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NGO-led intensive, high-cost models increased assets and incomes in the short to medium term but rarely enabled households to exit the program. NGO-led lighter-touch approaches improved resilience but delivered minimal gains in overall well-being. Government-led efforts have faced persistent delivery challenges, including overstretched systems, weak credit access, and limited market linkages. Broader structural constraints, such as shrinking landholdings, scarce nonfarm opportunities, and recurrent drought and other shocks, further undermine the promise of graduation programming in this context.

As an alternative, ‘point-based’ mapping of soil water content can improve global soil data availability and quality. We developed point-based global maps with estimated uncertainty of the volumetric SWR at 100, 330 and 15 000 cm suction using measured SWR data extracted from the WoSIS Soil Profile Database together with data estimated by a random forest PTF (PTF-RF). The point data was combined with around 200 environmental covariates describing vegetation, terrain morphology, climate, geology, and hydrology using DSM. In total, we used 7292, 33 192 and 42 016 SWR point observations at 100, 330 and 15 000 cm, respectively, and complemented the dataset with 436 108 estimated values at each suction. Tenfold cross-validation yielded a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.380, 7.112 and 6.485 10−2cm3cm−3, and a Model Efficiency Coefficient (MEC) of 0.430, 0.386, and 0.471, respectively, for 100, 330 and 15 000 cm.

Point-based mapping performed better than the three map-based mapping approaches for 330 and 15 000 cm, while for 100 cm results were similar, possibly due to the limited number of SWR observations for 100 cm. Major sources or uncertainty identified included the geographical clustering of the data and the limitation of the covariates to represent the naturally high variation of SWR.","2023-06","2025-10-17 14:08:54","2025-10-21 19:06:00","2025-10-17 14:08:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476609  Publisher: Elsevier","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\TWRSWFLQ\Turek et al. - 2023 - Global mapping of volumetric water retention at 100, 330 and 15 000 cm suction using the WoSIS datab.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476609","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the forest habitat, the pest was prevalent in all but two ecological regions: the Congolian swamp forests and the Southern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic. In the savannah habitat, it was restricted to the moist savannah highlands and absent from dry savannahs. The scale was not observed below 277 m asl.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of environmental conditions, P450 inhibitors, rice cultivar response, and gene expression on FPB selectivity in rice. Field experiments established in a randomized block design showed that rice plant injury due to two FPB rates (30 and 60 g ai ha−1) was affected by planting time and rice stage at herbicide application. The injury was higher at the earliest planting season and more in younger plants (V2) than larger (V6 and R0). However, no yield reduction was detected. Under greenhouse conditions, two dose-response experiments in a randomized block design showed that spraying malathion (1 kg ha−1) before FPB application did not reduce herbicide selectivity. The addition of two P450 inhibitors (dietholate and piperonyl butoxide, 10 g a.i. seed-kg−1 and 4.2 kg ai ha−1, respectively) decreased the doses to cause 50% of plant injury (ED50) and growth reduction (GR50). However, it seems not to compromise crop selectivity. Pampeira cultivar showed lower ED50 and GR50 than IRGA 424 RI. A growth chamber experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design to evaluate the gene expression of rice plants sprayed with FPB (30 and 60 g ai ha−1). Results showed downregulation of OsWAKL21.2, an esterase probably related to bio-activation of FPB-ester. However, no effect was detected on CYP71A21 monooxygenase and OsGSTL transferase, enzymes probably related to FPB degradation. Further research should focus on understanding FBP bio-activation as the selective mechanism.","2021-12-14","2025-10-17 13:57:52","2025-10-21 19:05:57","2025-10-17 13:57:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476597  Publisher: MDPI","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\JFK9LQ2C\Velásquez et al. - 2021 - Florpyrauxifen-Benzyl Selectivity to Rice.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476597","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The avocado production suffers from many limitations such as, lack of well-organized market system, inadequate skill of post-harvest handling and lack of market information system in the study area. The specific objectives of the study to assess market channel, identifying factors influencing market supply of avocado fruit and examining market supply performance of avocado fruits in the study area. Age, education level, livestock holding, farm size, quantity produce, market information, distance to the nearest market, access for transportation and selling price of produce related positively and negatively with market supply performance of avocado fruit. Multi-stage sampling technique was used to draw the sample of fruit producer farmers. The sample size was 115 farmers/suppliers and 10 traders for crosscheck. Data has been collected using well-structured close ended questionnaires by using enumerators from a randomly selected sample of 115 avocado fruit farmers from Lemo District and cross checking data collected from 10 traders from Hosanna town. The collected data analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS-20); reliability and diagnosis test of the collected data has been checked. Descriptive, correlation and regression analysis has been done. The result reveled that, age, education level, quantity produce, access for market information, access for transportation, distance to the nearest market and selling price of the produce influences market supply performance of avocado fruit at significant level and poor market supply channel, poor market supply performance of avocado fruit in the study area.

In the light of a renewed government strategy to use improved inputs and practices to enhance smallholder agricultural productivity and production, strengthening the evidence‐base for the design and implementation of such a strategy becomes central. This paper reviews and synthesizes the findings of seven recent graduate theses researched in Ethiopia, and aims to identify underlying factors influencing the use of improved agricultural inputs among farmers. It shows that farmers’ education strongly influences improved input use across activity areas. Smallholder farmers who used such inputs for commercial production of crops and livestock products are better able to assess market opportunities, have more assets and/or income, and have better access to extension services and credit. However a large number of factors that influence improved inputs use were technology or location specific. The evidence suggests that transforming subsistence, low input‐low output agriculture into market‐oriented, high inputhigh output agriculture entails diverse strategies including promoting cross‐cutting factors like education, infrastructure and participation from women in agricultural development, and equally, targeting interventions like credit to the specific needs of farmers, their local contexts and technological attributes.","2011-08-15","2025-10-17 13:59:45","2025-10-30 16:36:23","2025-10-17 13:59:45","","","","","","","Farmers’ use of improved agricultural inputs and practices","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752172  Publisher: International Livestock Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\JASBUWPD\Ayele and Bosire - 2011 - Farmers’ use of improved agricultural inputs and practices review and synthesis of research in Ethi.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752172","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forty-two Doyogena yearling rams with an initial body weight of 28.95kg (mean±SE) were randomly divided into six feeding groups of seven animals per treatment in a completely randomized block design. The experiment was conducted for 90 days of feeding trial and 14 days of adaptation. All collected data throughout the experimental period were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the statistical analysis software SAS (9.2 version). All animals were fed on natural pastures and nuge seed cakes. The supplements were offered at the rate of 300 g/day, which were offered twice per day during morning and night; (T1)control group grazing only+120 nuge seed cake, (T2) grazing+180gwheat bran+120g nuge seed cake, (T3) grazing+135g wheat bran+120g nuge seed cake + 45g corm (T4) grazing+90g wheat bran+120 g nuge seed cake + 90g corm,( T5) grazing+45g wheat bran+120 g nuge seed cake +135g corm and T6 grazing+0 g wheat bran+120 g nuge seed cake+180gr corm.. Higher weight gain of the sheep was recorded for sixth treatment (16.5kg/90d) days. FCE was higher for those sheep fed on 180g enset corm compared to sheep fed 180g wheat bran. The partial budget analysis shows that the change in total variable cost of all treatment groups was positive, but the net return was obtained in the order of T3>T6>T4>T5>T2>T1. The result of the present study has indicated that in areas where access to wheat bran is absent, enset corms could be used as a potential alternative to replace wheat bran as long as it is economically feasible and easily accessible for smallholder production systems. Thus, based on the present finding, it can be concluded that enset corm has the potential to be a 100% replacement for wheat bran in terms of energy feed without compromising the growth performance and financial effectiveness of sheep fattening.","2024-10-30","2025-10-17 13:56:24","2025-10-21 19:05:55","2025-10-17 13:56:24","","","","","","","","","","","","Wachemo University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476588","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\XL5824JW\Abebe - 2024 - Evaluation of Replacing Wheat Bran with Ensete Ventricosum Corm on Feed Intake, Weight Gain, in vitr.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476588","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Questionnaire survey and laboratory diagnostic methods were used for the study. In the questionnaire survey, 384 beekeepers (350 male and 34 female) were interviewed. Similarly, a total of 384 honey bee colonies in 87 apiary sites were examined for the presence of honeybee external parasites and disease pathogens. Regarding honeybee pests and predators, the rank index confirmed that the most important pests and predators affecting honeybee colonies were ants (24.8%), wax moth (24.7%), birds (15.5%), honey badger (13.7%), lizards (9%), spiders (12%) and death head’s hawks moth (5.4%). The total honeybee colonies absconded due to the major honeybee pests was estimated to be 1019(38.8%). About 13%, 12.4%, 9.8% and 3.6% of the colonies absconded were due to wax moth, ants, honey badger and death head’s hawks moth respectively. Colony level prevalence of Varroa mite was 61.2% and 53.4 % during honey flow and dearth period seasons respectively. There was statistically significant (p<0.05) variation in overall prevalence of Varroa infestation between comb age, colony strength, seasons and among agro ecologies (p<0.01).Management affected the observed prevalence of bee lice with the overall colony level prevalence of 27.% and 5.73% during honey flow and dearth period seasons, respectively. Nosema and Chalk brood diseases were detected only during honey flow season with overall colony level prevalence of 38.8% and 16.9%, respectively. Amoeba was observed during the study seasons with highest colony level prevalence of 62.5% during the honey flow season. The result indicated that unlike honeybee pests and predators, the impact of honeybee external parasites and disease pathogens did not significantly affected honeybee colony strength. However, long term seasonal colony monitoring would be recommended.","2015-10-30","2025-10-17 13:49:34","2025-10-21 19:05:54","2025-10-17 13:49:34","","","","","","","","","","","","Bahir Dar University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476585","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\IQAFSHS6\Godifey - 2015 - Epidemiology of honey bee disease and pests in selected zones of Tigray Region, northern Ethiopia.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476585","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Soil samples were collected before planting and after forage harvest. The treatments were desho vetch intercropping at a 12kg/ha seed rate for vetch (T1), desho vetch intercropping at a 9kg/ha seed rate for vetch (T2), desho vetch intercropping at 6kg/ha seed rate for vetch (T3), sole desho grass (T4) and sole vetch (T5). Data on biomass yield; plant height and chemical compositions were recorded and analyzed using the General Linear Model procedures of SAS. Relative yield, relative yield total, and aggressivity index were calculated for biological compatibility and yield advantages of desho and vetch (V.villosa). The pre- sowing soil analysis showed that the experimental soil had average pH of 6.73. This indicates that the soil was slightly acidic. Intercropping vetch with desho grass resulted in significantly higher total dry matter yield than sole desho grass at all cutting stages. The highest total dry matter yield (16.04-26.3 t/ha) was obtained from T1. The highest forage CP content (%) was obtained from T1 (10.07-13.45%) at all harvesting stages. On the other hand, significantly (P<0.05) higher ADF, ADL and NDF contents (%) was obtained from sole desho grass. Significantly higher in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) was obtained from intercropped desho grass with vetch (T1; 60.24, T2; 58.54 and T3; 60.03) at all cutting stages compared to the pure stand. The relative yield total of desho-vetch mixtures were greater than one, showing a yield advantage over the pure stand. The higher organic carbon percentage in tested soil after forage harvest in all vetch based treatments was probably due to improved soil fertility. The intercropping at a 12kg/ha seed rate for vetch has the potential to provide maximize production and productivity in study area and thus can be recommended for further evaluation and application.","2022-10-31","2025-10-17 14:12:07","2025-10-21 19:05:52","2025-10-17 14:12:07","","","","","","","","","","","","Wachemo University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476576","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\TSL9V2FB\Berhanu - 2022 - Effects of intercropping desho grass with vetch on forage yield, nutritional quality and soil fertil.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476576","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The poorest households tend to be physically and socially isolated and face disadvantages across multiple dimensions, which makes moving out of extreme poverty challenging and costly. This paper compares the cost-effectiveness of three strands of anti-poverty social protection interventions by reviewing 30 livelihood development programs, 11 lump-sum unconditional cash transfers, and seven graduation programs.1 All the selected graduation initiatives focused on the extreme poor, while the livelihood development and cash transfer programs targeted a broader set of beneficiaries. Impacts on annual household consumption (or on income when consumption data were not available) per dollar spent were used to benchmark cost-effectiveness across programs.2 Among all 48 programs reviewed, lump-sum cash transfers were found to have the highest benefit-cost ratio, though there are very few lump-sum cash transfer programs that serve the extreme poor or measure long-term impacts. Livelihood programs that targeted the extreme poor had much lower benefit-cost ratios. Graduation programs are more cost-effective than the livelihood programs that targeted the extreme poor and measured long-term impacts (i.e., at least one year after end of interventions). More evidence is needed, especially on long-term impacts of lump-sum cash transfers to the extreme poor, to make better comparisons among the three types of programs for sustainable reduction of extreme poverty.","2016","2025-10-16 23:11:33","2025-10-21 19:05:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476579","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\NBMYAGY2\Sulaiman et al. - Eliminating Extreme Poverty Comparing the Cost-Effectiveness of Livelihood, Cash Transfer, and Grad.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476579","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The varieties included Mosisa (T1), Walki (T2), Degaga (T3), Shallo (T4) and local (T5) which were grown at Sinana Agricultural Research Center. The experiment consisted of 7 days of digestibility trial and 90 days of feeding trial followed by evaluation of carcass parameters at the end of the feeding period. Randomized complete block design was used for the experiment. The experimental animals were grouped into eight blocks of five animals each based on their initial body weight and each animal within each block was randomly assigned to one of the five treatment diets. Yield were significantly different (P<0.001) among varieties evaluated. Crude protein (CP) contents of faba bean straws were 4.9, 5.1, 5.2, 4.3 and 6.2% for Mosisa, Walki, Degaga, Shallo and local respectively and that of wheat bran (WB) and “noug” seed cake (NSC) were 13 and 26.8% respectively. The DM intake of sheep in T2 (754.3 g/day) was higher (P<0.001) than T1, T4 and T5 but did not differ (P>0.001) from T3 (717.9 g/day) and sheep in T3 had higher (P<0.001) DM intake than sheep in T1 and T4. CP intake for T5 was significantly greater (P<0.001) than T3, T1 and T4 whereas no significant difference (P>0.001) from T2. The apparent digestibility of DM of T1, T2 and T3 were greater (P<0.05) than T4 but did not differ (P>0.05) from T5. The OM digestibility was significantly higher (P<0.05) for sheep in T2 than T4. The CP digestibility of sheep in T5 was higher (P<0.001) than that of T3 and T4 but similar (P>0.001) with sheep in T1 and T2 whereas CP digestibility of T1 and T2 were also higher (P<0.001) than T4. Sheep in T2 had greater (P<0.01) average daily gain (64.6 g/day) than sheep in T3 (43.2 g/day), T4 (37.5 g/day) and T5 (48.3 g/day) but no difference (P>0.01) from T1 (52.2 g/day). Feed conversion efficiency was higher (P<0.05) for sheep in T2 as compared to T3, T4 and T5 whereas similar with values obtained for T1. Slaughter body weight and empty body weight were higher (P<0.05) for sheep in T1 and T2 as compared to sheep in T4 but similar (P>0.05) among others. Apart from this, the other carcass components were not affected (P>0.05) by variety of the faba bean straws. It can be concluded that there is significant difference between faba bean straws from different varieties in feed intake, digestibility, body weight gain and feed conversion efficiency and that faba bean straws when supplemented with concentrate had higher potential as animal feed. Based on these results, Walki and Mosisa varieties could be recommended as pulse crop rotation with cereals in the study area.","2016-01-30","2025-10-17 14:13:51","2025-10-21 19:05:51","2025-10-17 14:13:51","","","","","","","","","","","","Haramaya University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476574","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\SCCMC4R6\Wegi - 2016 - Effects of feeding different varieties of faba bean (Vicia faba L.) straws with concentrate on feed.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476574","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the impacts of the interventions on indicators of some ecosystem services were not assessed. The objectives of this study were to explore the effects of the interventions on soil properties, soil moisture content and water discharge, plant species richness, biomass production and carbon stock by comparing treated site with integrated land management measures and the adjacent untreated site. Samples were collected from treated and untreated sites in the upper and lower slope positions, from cropland, grazing land and Tree Lucerne plantation based on standard procedures for each objective. The collected data were analyzed following standard statistical procedures with respect to treatment, slope position, land-use type, and soil depth. The introduced integrated land management significantly (p ≤ 0.001) improved most of the soil physicochemical properties, the soil moisture content, water discharge, plant species richness, biomass production and carbon stocks. Clay, total N, available P and soil organic carbon were significantly higher at p = 0.001 and exchangeable K at p = 0.05 in the treated site compared to the untreated one. This could be due to higher organic matter accumulation and improved vegetation growth as a result of prohibited free grazing, and reduced erosion by the conservation structures. Sand and bulk density were significantly (p = 0.001) higher in the untreated site that could be attributed to erosion due to absence of conservation measures and compaction by livestock trampling during free grazing practice. Generally, the introduced integrated land management measure improved clay content of the soil by 63.51%, OC by 133%, NPK of the soil by 69.84%, 78.49% and 22.73% respectively. The soil moisture content increased by 14.82 19.35% and water discharge increased by 588% over the untreated one, which could be due to reduced runoff and evaporation, improved infiltration and storage processes attributed by the conservation structures and vegetation covers. Besides, total plant richness, regeneration of shrubs and indigenous tree species were increased by 18%(N=27),70.59% (N=12) and 66.67% (N=2) respectively, in the treated site compared to the untreated one. In addition, an average 10.72±0.84 Mg ha-1 additional carbon stock was observed due to the intervention. Prohibited free grazing and land-use change could have contributed to higher species richness, regeneration of indigenous trees and accumulation of higher plant biomass and accumulation of higher carbon stocks. Tree Lucerne plot showed higher biomass production and carbon stock by plant biomass depicting the positive impact of land-use changes. Tree Lucerne plot significantly (p = 0.05) improved the upper soil carbon stock which could be due to its N fixing capacity and fast decomposition of the leaves. However, the lower soil carbon stock was significantly (p = 0.001) higher in the crop land of the treated site which could be ascribed to the conservation structures and tillage operations, that conservation structures trap and accumulate transported organic materials from upper slope; and tillage facilitates aeration and decomposition processes. Planting Tree Lucerne combined with physical structures as a biological measure and on highly degraded part of the landscape resulted higher plant biomass production and carbon stock through plant biomass. Thus, integrating physical, biological, and grazing management is a good land-use practice to be expanded to other degraded landscapes.","2020-06-15","2025-10-17 13:49:16","2025-10-21 19:05:50","2025-10-17 13:49:16","","","","","","","","","","","","Addis Ababa University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476571","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\HK6VP8TH\Terefe - 2020 - Effect of integrated land management, slope position and land-use type on soil physicochemical prope.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476571","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sheep were blocked into six blocks of five sheep based on their initial body weight and animals from each block were randomly assigned to five treatment groups with six replications per treatment in randomized complete block design (RBCD). Barley straw was fed ad libitum as a sole diet in treatment 1 (T1) and as a basal diet supplemented with 100, 200, 300 and 400g dried tagasaste leaf in the other treatments i.e. T2, T3, T4 and T5, respectively. A 90- day growth experiment and 7- day digestibility trial were conducted. Dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), and crude protein (CP) intakes increased (P<0.05) with increasing levels of tagasaste leaf in the diets. Sheep fed T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 diets gained (P<0.05) -5.5, 19.2, 40.7, 61.8 and 71.8 g/head/ day, respectively. The apparent digestibility of DM, OM, CP, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber significantly increased (P<0.05) with increasing levels of tagasaste leaf supplementation. The hot carcass weight showed a significant increase from T1 (6.9 kg) to T5 (11 kg) with increasing level of supplementation. Dressing percentage on slaughter weight basis and empty body weight basis did not differ (P>0.05) among treatments, but dressing percentage on empty body weight basis have higher than on slaughter weight basis this imply that the influence of digesta. Supplementing a basal diet of barley straw with tagasaste leaves improved DM intake, BWG, digestibility of nutrients and carcass. It is concluded that 400g/d/head of tagasaste leaf can serve as a protein supplement to low quality feed during dry season for efficient performance of sheep.","2016-05-30","2025-10-17 14:08:51","2025-10-21 19:05:50","2025-10-17 14:08:51","","","","","","","","","","","","Hawassa University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476569","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\6WTF54PW\Mengesha - 2016 - Effect of graded levels of Tagasaste (Chamaecytisus palmensis) leaves supplementation on performance.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476569","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nineteen government and NGO programs, four policy documents, and an estimate of one billion USD investments were influenced by MCSAS. Following the MCSAS, the National Climate-Smart Agriculture Center of Yezin Agricultural University was established in 2018. Several projects focusing on farmers, particularly the Climate-Smart Village in the Dry Zone and the Farmer Field School in the Delta Zone, were also studied to understand the depth of the influence of MCSAS. In these cases, climate-smart practices adopted have helped farmers coped with climate change and increased their household incomes. Nevertheless, suggestions were made to further improve the Strategy with more specific actions that could be implemented and the funding options that implementers could pursue. The Strategy also needs to be integrated into the current programs of the government and its contents translated in the local language in a format that local people can understand.","2019-12-23","2025-10-17 14:03:03","2025-10-21 19:05:49","2025-10-17 14:03:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476566","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\8CFDJGSV\Htwe et al. - 2019 - Documenting the application of the Myanmar Climate-Smart Agriculture Strategy.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476566","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines the medium-term effects of Egypt’s f lagship cash transfer program, Takaful, on several measures of household wellbeing using a regression discontinuity (RD) design. Findings reveal no significant impacts on household consumption (total, food or non-food), but notable decreases in monthly wage income that are comparable in magnitude to the average monthly transfer. Employment patterns are suggestive of a decrease in hours worked in formal labour among men. There are positive effects on asset ownership, particularly productive assets, indicating a shift toward longer-term investments. Reductions in informal debt suggest improved financial health among beneficiaries and increases in enrollment in primary and preparatory school suggest increased human capital investment as well. These results underscore the potential of cash transfer programs to foster economic stability and investments in the future, even in the absence of significant immediate consumption effects.","2024-12-30","2025-10-17 14:00:04","2025-10-21 19:05:49","2025-10-17 14:00:04","","","","","","","Don’t spend it all in one place","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476567  Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\HLKIX7NI\Karachiwalla et al. - 2024 - Don’t spend it all in one place The medium-term effects of a national cash transfer program on hous.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476567","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diversification can also enable small-scale producers to cope better with livelihood shocks. However, it is not always clear through which pathways diversification practices can stabilize livelihoods and food security in small-scale production systems, especially in the context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In this study we examined whether and how diversification practices stabilized income and food availability in small-scale food production systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The diversification practices explored in this study included fish polyculture and integrated aquaculture-agriculture (IAA), and their combination. We compared small-scale systems employing different combinations of these diversification strategies, with systems that did not contain them. METHODS: We analyzed 300 surveys of small-scale aquaculture producers in Myanmar. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the multivariate relationships between the adoption of diversification practices among the small-scale producers, and whether and how the adoption stabilized their livelihoods during the COVID-19 pandemic in Myanmar. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We find that the integration of diversification practices in different small-scale aquaculture-agriculture (SSAA) production systems had generally positive effects for the stabilization of income, food availability or both during the COVID-19 pandemic. The novelty of the study is the unraveling of the differentiated pathways between production models that enabled these stabilization processes emerge. We find major divergences in the stabilization potential between polyculture and IAA, both in terms of the magnitudes of the stabilization effects and the pathways. Polyculture generally offered more significant stabilizing effects than IAA. Surprisingly the highest and more significant positive effects for the stabilization of food availability came through the purchase of food items from extra fish/crop income, rather than their increased self-consumption. SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, the SSAA production systems combining different diversification practices could form proactive strategies to help small-scale food producers cope with livelihood shocks.","2024-05-01","2025-10-17 13:56:48","2025-10-21 19:05:48","2025-10-17 13:56:48","","","","","","","Diversification strategies have a stabilizing effect for income and food availability during livelihood shocks","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476561  Publisher: Elsevier Masson","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\Z5ZYKYFU\Wang et al. - 2024 - Diversification strategies have a stabilizing effect for income and food availability during livelih.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476561","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"WTVFMEQK","report","2024","BOMA","2024 Annual Report","","","","","https://www.boma.ngo/wp-content/uploads/woocommerce_uploads/2025/04/BOMA-2024-Annual-Report-c6bdbp.pdf","As we reflect on 2024, I am filled with immense gratitude for what we have accomplished together. BOMA closed 2024 with a historic milestone: transforming the lives of over one million people. This achievement represents entire families breaking free from extreme poverty, women, youth and refugees empowered to become entrepreneurs, and communities strengthened through opportunity, resilience, and most importantly, hope. One of our proudest achievements in 2024 was deepening and expanding our partnership with the Government of Kenya. Through our flagship program (Kuza Jamii) we are not only scaling solutions to end extreme poverty in Kenya but also ensuring government ownership of economic inclusion and social protection initiatives. As we start a new year, we are committed to strengthening these partnerships to create sustainable pathways for economic independence across Kenya and beyond. At BOMA, we recognize that one size does not fit all. Our programs are designed to respond to the specific challenges faced by communities: from climate changeinduced famine to mass displacement. Our adapted solutions seek to address some of Africa’s toughest challenges at their root, and we continue to refine and improve. Our Rural Entrepreneur Access Project (REAP) model remains the cornerstone of our work, equipping participants with financial literacy, business skills, and access to savings groups, helping them break the cycle of poverty. This year, 99.9% of REAP participants in Kenya successfully graduated, demonstrating both the model’s continued success and determination of our entrepreneurs. Beyond Kenya, nearly 3,000 participants graduated from REAP in Ethiopia. Additional 2100 entrepreneurs are building sustainable businesses while also positively contributing to local conservation efforts. In Chad 1,500 vulnerable youth and refugees are gaining skills and resources needed to build sustainable businesses generating income and savings for their families. We also continue to support partners in Uganda, South Sudan, Burkina Faso and Cameroon to adopt, adapt replicate our adaptive solutions. 2024 marked a transition in BOMA’s leadership as Perry Boyle stepped down as the Chair of BOMA’s Global Board after six years of transformative leadership. Under Perry’s guidance, BOMA reached over one million individuals, strengthened governance, and built a dynamic leadership team. We now welcome Elsie Mbugua as our new board chair, whose leadership will propel us forward in expanding our mission. BOMA’s work is not just about programs and policies. It’s about people and community. It’s about women like Miriam Lekolo, uplifting others in her community to transform their lives through financial independence and savings. Or Esther Kojo, from the world’s youngest country, South Sudan, working hard to not only grow multiple livelihoods, but foster peace and reconciliation within her household and between communities. Stories like these, many of which are featured in this report, are what drive us forward. They remind us that every business started, every skill learned, and every life changed is a spark of positive transformation for a family and even a whole community. We embark on 2025 with renewed determination but also mindful of the unprecedented challenges ahead. The sudden and drastic cuts in US foreign aid have upended the global funding landscape, shutting down lifesaving programs and humanitarian aid supporting millions of the poorest women and children across Africa’s drylands. Considering its growing need, we are even more convinced that cost-effective and proven solutions like our REAP models, that help build selfsufficiency and agency, need to reach more people, more urgently. Thank you for walking the journey with us of helping one million people build a path out of poverty so far. Your support, partnership, and belief in BOMA’s mission are the foundation upon which we build a future of hope and opportunity for millions more.","2024","2025-10-23 15:52:34","2025-10-22 09:41:05","2025-10-23 15:52:34","","","","","","","BOMA (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498834","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\V7V39W6J\BOMA-2024-Annual-Report-c6bdbp.pdf","","P05","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498834","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The manifestation of climate change and variability includes rising atmospheric temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, accompanied by the extreme weather events. Spawned largely by anthropogenic forces, comprising, among other things, demographic explosion, rapid urbanization, deforestation, over-grazing, agricultural intensification and extensification; the distribution of climate change impacts are rather uneven across the world. While Africa contributes the least emissions of carbon compounds blamed for global warming; the region has suffered some of the most severe impacts of the phenomenon. Over the past several decades, the global climate change has unleashed natural disasters around the world, triggering considerable loss and damage to people’s lives and property. It has also fueled humanitarian crises, particularly in developing countries, which depend largely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. Crop failure, often associated with drought, and driven by climate variability, has devastated several low-income countries, with grave implications for food and nutrition insecurity. Increasing hazards, associated with the global climate change spurred the international development community to establish Disaster Risk Reduction frameworks as instruments to tackle climate-related risks and foster resilience, particularly among the poor and vulnerable segments of the population in the most affected countries around the world. Consequently, the World Bank, in 2014, established the Adapted Social Protection Program (ASPP) in the Sahel, covering Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. With donor funding, the World Bank has supported the six countries with US75 million for the initiative, comprising cash transfers, as well as cash-for-work projects. In a progress report on the ASPP in 2017, the World Bank reveals the considerable success associated with the initiative, which drives the innovative social protection systems in the Sahel along a path of resilience, improved livelihoods and prosperity among the poorest and most vulnerable elements of the population.","2022","2025-10-23 15:53:12","2025-10-30 16:36:34","2025-10-23 15:53:12","221-243","","","","","","Igbatayo (2022)","","","","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752210","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\RCE85J5N\Development-of-Multi-Hazard-Early-Warning-System-in-India.pdf","","Climate change; Resilience; Disaster; Sahel; Social protection; Risk reduction; P11","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752210","Eslamian Saeid; Eslamian Faezeh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the region’s countries rank as highly vulnerable and least prepared to face climate change risks, as insecurity, rising food prices and weak national governance systems further exacerbate existing vulnerability of many communities. In this context, aligning social protection and climate change adaptation objectives may have the potential to accelerate chronic poverty reduction as well as adaptive capacities of poor households and increase climate resilience. This report is part of a study series on adaptive social protection, exploring whether and how practices on the ground are changing, if climate risks are considered in the design of social protection programmes, and whether adaptation measures are built into the support provided through existing schemes. Findings from the regional Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Programme and the national social protection system in Mauritania highlight the opportunities associated with closer alignment and the significant challenges that remain.","2023","2025-10-23 15:53:12","2025-10-22 09:41:05","2025-10-23 15:53:12","","","","","","","Desai (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498978","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\99QU8EJJ\report.pdf","","⛔ No DOI found; P11","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121498978","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chars are formed from silt deposits and are prone to erosion and flooding. Char dwellers face many obstacles, including limited livelihood options and are heavily reliant on selling their physical labour. Like other parts of rural Bangladesh, people from chars temporarily migrate to urban areas in search of work, especially during the lean season. Health care and educational facilities in the chars are very limited and rather poorly resourced. Farmers often suffer from limited availability of agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizers, insecticides, implements, fuel and feed for their livestock. Households wishing to sell miscellaneous items like vegetables, milk, chicken and duck are constrained by their remoteness to markets that are usually at a fair distance from their villages. With more than twenty different projects, CLP supported 133,026 extreme poor families in ten districts through eighteen partner NGOs. The programme achieved a good deal of success and generated useful learning experience for future work in reducing poverty in such remote areas in Bangladesh.","2021","2025-10-23 15:53:33","2025-10-30 16:36:42","2025-10-23 15:53:33","341-359","","","","","","Hossain (2021)","","","","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752240","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\FWC7RT5B\499626_1_En_Print.indd.pdf","","Food security; Poverty reduction; P02; Char livelihoods; Empowerment of women; New economic opportunities; Resilience to risks; Social and organizational leadership development","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752240","Zaman Mohammad; Alam Mustafa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large body of evidence across numerous settings shows that cash and food transfer programs are highly effective in doing so. However, there is growing interest in understanding the extent to which such programs can help households stay out of poverty in the longer term, specifically after transfers end. We bring new evidence to this question, re-interviewing Bangladeshi households that participated in a well-implemented randomized social protection intervention four years after it ended. We find that combining transfers, either cash or food, with behavior change communication activities sustainably reduced poverty. Cash transfers alone had sustainable effects, but these were context-specific.

Social protection programs that provide cash or in-kind transfers alone often show limited short-term effects on agriculture or nutrition outcomes, although there is evidence of impacts of cash transfers alone on child nutrition in cases of extreme deprivation or when transfers are very large. The flagship’s research shows that social protection programs that bundle cash or in-kind transfers with high-quality complementary programming can generate large, significant improvements in agriculture and nutrition outcomes. Such complementary programming includes agricultural extension and nutrition behavior change communication (BCC).","2021-04-27","2025-10-17 13:56:38","2025-10-21 19:06:40","2025-10-17 13:56:38","","","","","","","Social protection for agriculture and resilience","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476761  Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\VJJU6W3Y\CGIAR Research Program on Policies - 2021 - Social protection for agriculture and resilience Highlights, lessons learned, and priorities for On.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476761","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The evaluation design incorporates two dimensions of randomization — community-level randomization to treatment and control, and individual-level randomization among eligible individuals — and a sample of 2,718 individuals was tracked over five years. The findings suggest that cash for work leads to significant increases in labor market engagement, assets, consumption, financial inclusion, civic engagement, psychological well being, and women’s em powerment one-year post-treatment; however, these effects have largely attenuated to zero five years post-treatment, with the exception of a positive effect on assets.

We assess whether a social assistance program – the Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI) –influenced the effects of prior monsoon flooding on household consumption and adult diets in southern Bangladesh. TMRI provided cash or food transfers, with or without nutrition behavior change communication, from 2012-2014. Within the study sites and years, flooding was substantial but moderate. Our findings suggest that, without TMRI, a one-standard-deviation increase in lagged flooding led to households smoothing consumption by drawing down savings and reducing diet quality among both men and women. In contrast, among TMRI treatment households, lagged flooding did not reduce savings, and both men’s and women’s diet quality improved. Effects on diet quality appeared largely driven by legumes and by fruits and vegetables, and improvements appeared strongest among households receiving both transfers and behavior change communication. Results indicate that social assistance can help households cope with effects of moderate flooding in southern Bangladesh, protecting household savings and improving both men’s and women’s diets.","2024-12-30","2025-10-17 13:58:00","2025-10-21 19:06:40","2025-10-17 13:58:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476759  Publisher: CGIAR System Organization","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\UEZVYTU8\Ahmed et al. - 2024 - Social assistance and adaptation to flooding in Bangladesh.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476759","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vast majority of the rural population’s livelihood is partly based on livestock production. However, livestock production and productivity and producers’ benefits from livestock production are far below expectations. Understanding the livestock production and marketing characteristics and producers’ needs and perceptions, identifying constraints and opportunities, and designing workable production strategies are required in order to improve livestock productivity and market success of producers. Based on a series of IPMS studies, this paper synthesises and analyses the characteristics, constraints and opportunities of sheep and goat production and marketing in Ethiopia. The paper also puts forward strategic interventions for improving sheep and goat productivity and producers market success. Livestock production systems in Ethiopia have evolved largely as a result of the influence of the natural production environments and socio-economic circumstances of farmers/ pastoralists, rather than market forces. Livestock production is of subsistence nature. Like all other livestock species, sheep and goat in Ethiopia are kept under traditional extensive systems with no or minimal inputs and improved technologies, which results in characteristically low productivity. They are virtually kept as scavengers, particularly in the mixed crop–livestock systems. Sheep and goat are largely produced in mixed crop–livestock, specialized pastoral and agropastoral systems. Market-oriented or commercial production is almost non-existent. Small flock sizes predominate in the highland mixed crop–livestock systems because of land and capital limitations. Relatively larger flocks are maintained in the lowland (agro) pastoral systems. The major feed resources for sheep and goats include grazing on communal natural pasture, crop stubble, fallow grazing, road side grazing, crop residues, browses, and non-conventional feeds (household food leftovers, weeds, crop tillers and fillers). Production of improved forages, improvement of low quality feed sources such as crop residues and supplementary feeding (except fattening) is almost non-existent.","2010-08-12","2025-10-17 14:12:25","2025-10-21 19:06:39","2025-10-17 14:12:25","","","","","","","Sheep and goat production and marketing systems in Ethiopia","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476757  Publisher: International Livestock Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\PBAC23Q4\Gizaw et al. - 2010 - Sheep and goat production and marketing systems in Ethiopia characteristics and strategies for impr.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476757","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, some soils become non responsive to Rhizobial inoculation. In an effort to find out possible correction, a field experiment was carried out on-farm, during 2016/17 growing season, at Gondar Zuria woreda in Tsion and Denzaz Kebeles to evaluate the effect of Rhizobium inoculation, S and Zn application on yield and yield parameters, nodulation, N and P uptake on chickpea. The soil at the experimental sites were previously diagnosed as non responsive to Rhizobium inoculation and P fertilizer application on chickpea (Cicer aritienum L.) and had low OM, N, P, S and Zn. The experiment included twelve treatments developed via factorial combination of two level of inoculation (Rhizobium inoculated, un-inoculated), three level of S (0, 15, 30 kg Sulphur ha-1) and two levels of Zn (0, 1.5 kg Zinc ha-1). The treatment was laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications. All plots have received basal application of 20 kg N ha-1and 20 kg P ha-1 uniformly. Zinc in the form of ZnSO4 was applied through foliar application and the remaining nutrients were applied at planting directly to the soil. Mean separation was made using the least significant difference (LSD) test at 5% level of probability. Analysis of variance showed that except plant height at both location and shoot dry weight and number of seed per pod at Tsion, all the remaining growth parameters (root length and root dry weight), yield and yield related traits (number of primary branches, number of pod, number of seed, hundred seed weight, grain and straw yield), crop phenology (days to 50% flowering and days to physiological maturity), nodulation scores (nodule number, nodule volume, nodule dry weight, effective nodule and nodulation rating), N and P uptake at both locations were significantly affected by the treatments. The highest (1775.5 kg ha-1) mean value of seed yield over locations was obtained from combined application of Rhizobium and 30 kg S ha-1 which resulted in 28 % (389 kg ha-1) increase over the control. The result also indicated that P use efficiency of chickpea was improved with Rhizobium inoculation and S fertilizer application. The partial budget analysis also showed that the maximum (ETB 37069 ha-1) and minimum (ETB 30050 ha-1) net benefit were obtained from combined application of Rhzobium inoculation and 30 kg S ha-1and from the control check, respectively. The result determined a net benefit penalty of 23.4% (ETB 7019 ha-1). Hence, Rhizobium inoculation with application of 30 kg S ha-1 could be recommended for chickpea production at the experimental locations in Gonder Zuria Woreda.","2017-07-30","2025-10-17 14:13:47","2025-10-21 19:06:36","2025-10-17 14:13:47","","","","","","","","","","","","Haramaya University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476746","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\67258L64\Shewangizaw - 2017 - Response of chickpea (Cicer aritienum L.) to sulphur and zinc nutrients application and rhizobium in.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476746","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nutrient-rich runoff from this waste contributes to eutrophication, while pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella contaminate surface waters, posing serious risks to human and animal health. Yet, this waste stream also presents opportunities for circular bioeconomy solutions. When converted into biogas, organic fertilizer, or aquaculture feed, livestock waste can help mitigate environmental harm, generate energy, enhance soil health, and support rural livelihoods. This report synthesizes findings from 135 global cases and further presents an in-depth analysis of 26 livestock waste recovery initiatives to highlight diverse models and regional strategies. The available data show that in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, biodigestion is primarily used for household or commercial energy and revenue generation. South and Southeast Asian countries, meanwhile, focus on producing compost, aquaculture feed, and vermicompost. Government support, including subsidies, incentives, and technical assistance, often underpins these efforts, sometimes in collaboration with the private sector. Three broad business models emerge: (i) energy and biofertilizer recovery, (ii) soil nutrient recovery, and (iii) food nutrient recovery for aquaculture. Government-led community initiatives tend to exhibit higher economic feasibility, while private-sector models tend to scale better commercially. With average payback periods of five to six years and cost-benefit ratios ranging from 1 to 2, these models offer scalable solutions—when backed by enabling policies, institutional coordination, and localized feasibility assessments—to promote sustainable rural development and address critical environmental risks.","2025-07-02","2025-10-17 14:11:54","2025-10-21 19:06:36","2025-10-17 14:11:54","","","","","","","Resource recovery from livestock waste","","","","","International Water Management Institute","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476745  DOI: 10.5337/2025.215","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\T75UXXSW\Taron et al. - 2025 - Resource recovery from livestock waste cases and business models from the Global South.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476745","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and more frequent extreme events have already demonstrated their effects on local, regional, and global agricultural systems. Crop varieties that withstand climate-related stresses and are suitable for cultivation in innovative cropping systems will be crucial to maximize risk avoidance, productivity, and profitability under climate-changed environments. We surveyed 588 expert stakeholders to predict current and novel traits that may be essential for future pearl millet, sorghum, maize, groundnut, cowpea, and common bean varieties, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. We then review the current progress and prospects for breeding three prioritized future-essential traits for each of these crops. Experts predict that most current breeding priorities will remain important, but that rates of genetic gain must increase to keep pace with climate challenges and consumer demands. Importantly, the predicted future-essential traits include innovative breeding targets that must also be prioritized; for example, (1) optimized rhizosphere microbiome, with benefits for P, N, and water use efficiency, (2) optimized performance across or in specific cropping systems, (3) lower nighttime respiration, (4) improved stover quality, and (5) increased early vigor. We further discuss cutting-edge tools and approaches to discover, validate, and incorporate novel genetic diversity from exotic germplasm into breeding populations with unprecedented precision, accuracy, and speed. We conclude that the greatest challenge to developing crop varieties to win the race between climate change and food security might be our innovativeness in defining and boldness to breed for the traits of tomorrow.","2023-10-01","2025-10-17 14:13:55","2025-10-21 19:06:35","2025-10-17 14:13:55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476739  Publisher: Elsevier","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\D4HK9VIN\Pixley et al. - 2023 - Redesigning crop varieties to win the race between climate change and food security.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476739","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, the inherent lag from the inception of research to the adoption of new technologies calls for sustained and stable R&D funding. In 2016, Africa invested just 0.39 percent of its agricultural gross domestic product (AgGDP) in agricultural R&D, down from 0.54 percent in 2000. Furthermore, only a handful of African countries invest at least 1 percent of their AgGDP in agricultural research; the target set by New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). Even though in absolute terms total R&D investment has increased since the turn of the millennium—after a period of stagnation—most of the funds have been directed toward research staff expansion, salary increases, and rehabilitation of derelict research infrastructure and equipment, rather than actual research programs. In fact, in a large number of African countries, the national government funds the salaries of researchers and support staff, but little else, leaving nonsalary-related expenses highly dependent on donors and other funding sources.","2021-11-23","2025-10-17 14:10:58","2025-10-21 19:06:35","2025-10-17 14:10:58","","","","","","","Report on boosting investment in agriculture research in Africa","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476742  Publisher: African Union","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\3SMZQ8RS\Union - 2021 - Report on boosting investment in agriculture research in Africa Building a case for increased inves.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476742","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bringing together government representatives from six regions, ILRI and the Ethiopian Veterinary Association (EVA) RESTORE teams, the RESTORE Technical Assistance Team (TAT), and NGOs, the event focused on reviewing public-private partnership (PPP) models tested under the Health of Ethiopian Animals for Rural Development (HEARD) project. Participants analysed lessons learned, validated successful models, and collaborated on a joint plan for scaling them out across the RESTORE and HEARD regions to enhance livestock health, productivity and resilience. The workshop focused on reviewing and validating public-private partnership (PPP) models previously tested under the HEARD project. Model I (Private vaccination service), Model II (Sanitary mandate), and Model VIII (Leasing public AHPs to unemployed graduates) were identified as the most suitable for scale-up. Key challenges highlighted included government subsidies and free NGO services undermining private sector involvement, limited cold chain capacity, vaccine supply shortages, unregulated drug markets, and gaps in legal and policy frameworks. The workshop emphasized the importance of gender integration, particularly including female-headed households, and encouraged treating pastoralist mobility as a resilience strategy rather than a barrier. The way forward includes scaling up successful PPP models with strong government ownership, tailoring models to regional needs, establishing supportive policies, and strengthening PPP taskforces, community animal health workers (CAHW) capacities, and infrastructure for long-term sustainability.","2025-07-30","2025-10-17 14:27:04","2025-10-21 19:06:34","2025-10-17 14:27:04","","","","","","","Public-private partnership for the delivery of veterinary services","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476736  Publisher: International Livestock Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\ZLM4E458\Berhanu et al. - 2025 - Public-private partnership for the delivery of veterinary services Workshop report on the review an.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476736","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Public food procurement policies can be used to promote healthy diets, based on sustainable food systems, in workplaces, schools, universities, hospitals, aged care facilities, and other venues at which public meals are provided. A key characteristic of public food procurement is that it offers the opportunity to determine the way food is procured in addition to what type of food is purchased (local, diverse, nutritious, healthy, culturally appropriate, etc.), from whom (smallholder farmers, small and medium food enterprises, women, youth, and/or other vulnerable groups), and from which type of production (from agroecology or organic or other modes of agricultural production that ensure environmental sustainability as well as biodiversity). In this Special Issue, we solicited a range of articles from academics, researchers, and practitioners exploring innovative approaches and methods in the field of sustainable public food procurement practice and policy, with a particular focus on the use of public food procurement policies as an instrument to promote environmental sustainability and possible means by which to measure its impacts, areas in which research is currently lacking.

Results are based on survey of 150 sample households and rapid appraisal of major sheep and goat markets. Flock distribution and holdings in different parts of the woreda vary and thus the study sites were stratified into mixed sheep-goat flock, goat dominating and sheep dominating sites. Average family size of the study area was 6.7. Literacy of household heads accounts 30%. Across the sites, mean holdings of total land, grazing land, cattle, sheep, goat and equine numbers varied significantly (P<0.05) with the goat dominating site having higher values) than the others. With respect to livestock holdings above half of the total TLU was recorded in goat dominant site. The mean holding of 7.4 sheep (P<0.05) and 11.5 goats (P<0.05), respectively are higher in sheep and goat dominating sites. Sheep and goats are primarily kept for sale to generate cash and majorities (98.9%) of goat owners extensively milk their flock for household consumption. Sucking young (22.8% lambs; 26.7% kids) and breeding female (39.3% ewes; 39.4% does) dominate the flock. Respondents reported that grazing on crop stubble (13.4%), private pastures (13.3%) and road sides (13.2%), weeds (11.6%), tillers and fillers (8.9%) from crop fields, cut-and-carry of browse species and grasses (9.1%) and communal pastures (9.4%) are major feedstuffs of sheep and goats. Flock water are largely comes from rivers (Bilate and Dijo) (55.2%), artificial ponds (21.9%), trough and harvested water. Diseases and parasites cause significant (P<0.05) losses of flocks (34.6%). Rate of loss is higher in young (35.0% lambs; 35.5% in kids) and mothers (42.9% in ewes; 30.6% in does). Losses by predators is noticeably higher (P<0.05) in goat dominating site. Body conformation, physical characteristics (coat color, horn and tail), known local ecotypes and age are the major criteria household considers in selecting sheep and goats for castration and fattening. Smallholder farmers make fattening management targeting the seasonal holiday markets. Major destination of fattened flocks is the Addis Ababa market while young flocks to the export abattoirs. Addis Ababa consumers demonstrated high preferences to animals from study areas and evidently pay higher prices. This is largely exploitable opportunity for development of smallholder sheep and goat production. Flock production is constrained by outbreaks of disease and parasite, predators, feed and water shortage, lack of production technology and seasonality of markets. Interventions covering flock health, feed production and managements, water development, marketing, credits to build flock holdings, and extension supports delivering the necessary training and production technologies/inputs could help farmers to built their flock and improve productivity.

Results are based on diagnostic survey of 160 sample households, group discussions, monitoring of 36 flocks and rapid appraisal of major sheep and goat markets. The study district was stratified into three groups based on flock distribution as: sheep dominating, goat dominating and mixed flock sites. The average land holding per household was 1.93 ha. On average, a household owned 3.6 cattle, 3.6 sheep, 2.1 goats, 0.2 equines and 2.7 chickens. In Goma where coffee and chat are the major cash sources for farmers, small ruminant are mainly kept for cash generation and saving in time of coffee failure. About 94% of the small ruminant owners reported to keep them for income generation. The second main reason for keeping small ruminant in the study area was for saving purpose. Keeping small ruminant for manure purpose was the third important reason. Other important reasons included for meat production and for risk distribution. Farmers kept larger proportion of female animals than male animals and it was rare to find male of advanced age as they were sold or slaughtered at early age. Fattening small ruminants is commonly practiced by most farmers and nowadays getting more attention due to high market demand and better prices. From the interviewed households, 59.4%, 32.1, 23.5%, and 19.4% of them utilize communal grazing, after math grazing, roadside grazing, and riverside grazing, respectively. Most small ruminants are either tethered or herded all the seasons due to the cultivation of perennial crops and predators. All small ruminants are housed for protection from adverse weather conditions and predators. Most lambings and kiddings occurred in the main rainy season. The average litter size, birth weight (kg), and weaning weight (kg) of sheep were found to be: 1.37, 2.86 and 11.59, respectively. The corresponding values for goats were 1.6, 2.76, and 9, respectively. There are five towns where small ruminants were marketed in addition to many villages that were used as primary market sources for small ruminants. Farmers, traders, brokers, restaurant/hotel owners, butchers are the major market participants. There is one main market route i.e., from Agaro to Addis. The major problems for small ruminant production and marketing were: feed and grazing land shortage, lack of input, predators, diseases and parasites and marketing problems. In order to utilize the current growing demand of small ruminant meat at local and international markets, identification of alternative feed resources and strategic feeding management, identification of causes of diseases and their control methods as well as improving marketing efficiency through appropriate policy and provision of information are areas of interventions.","2009-04","2025-10-17 14:09:48","2025-10-21 19:06:32","2025-10-17 14:09:48","","","","","","","","","","","","Hawassa University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476729","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\78TJBTXQ\Shenkute - 2009 - Production and marketing systems of small ruminants in Goma District of Jimma Zone, Western Ethiopia.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476729","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pervasive decline in output per unit of input (factor productivity) threatens the economic well-being and food security of producers and consumers of food in Uganda. Many households are both agricultural producers and consumers and have little access to other sources of livelihood (UBOS 2007). For these households, the declining productivity is particularly serious. Evidence is presented in this paper that improved agricultural inputs and extension information contribute to higher yields, but rates of adoption of improved agricultural inputs are low and many farmers have no access to extension services.

There is a lack of advocacy for landscape restoration among stakeholders, necessitating the establishment of a platform for knowledge exchange. The Alliance of Bioversity International, CIAT, and AICCRA organized a workshop to facilitate experience sharing among higher learning institutions, aiming to synergize efforts and scale up successful practices to contribute to national restoration initiatives. Ethiopian higher learning institutions have made significant progress in land restoration projects, showcasing their commitment to environmental sustainability and biodiversity enhancement. The preliminary results and achievements highlighted during the workshop demonstrate the impactful work being done by these institutions. By analyzing and publishing these results, valuable insights can be shared with end users, contributing to broader knowledge dissemination and potentially inspiring further landscape restoration initiatives in the country. Landscape restoration in higher learning institutions (HLIs) in Ethiopia presents a unique opportunity to address environmental challenges while enhancing educational experiences. In Ethiopia, HLIs can play a pivotal role in restoring degraded landscapes, conserving biodiversity, and promoting sustainable land management practices. By integrating native plant species, water-efficient landscaping, and eco-friendly infrastructure development, these institutions can create green spaces that serve as outdoor classrooms for students and research hubs for faculty. Engaging the community in restoration initiatives can also foster environmental awareness and contribute to broader conservation efforts in the country. Overall, landscape restoration in Ethiopian HLIs offers a holistic approach to environmental stewardship, innovation, and knowledge sharing within the academic community and beyond.","2024-07-10","2025-10-17 13:59:04","2025-10-30 16:36:33","2025-10-17 13:59:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752207","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\RJRLGHCK\Adimassu et al. - 2024 - Proceedings of the National Workshop on Experience Sharing in Landscape Restoration Research impleme.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752207","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It covers an area of about 1.14 million square kilometers. The country's topography consists of high and rugged plateaus and peripheral lowlands. Elevations in the country range from 160 meters below sea level (northern exit of the Rift Valley) to over 4600 meters above sea level (of northern mountainous regions). The highest mountains are concentrated on the northern and southern plateaus of the country. A large percentage of the country consists of high plateaus and mountain ranges, dissected by major rivers such as Blue Nile, Tekeze, Awash, Omo, Wabi Shebelle, etc. Overall, Ethiopia consists of 9 major rivers and 19 lakes. The Blue Nile, the chief headstream of the Nile, rises in Lake Tana in northwest Ethiopia. The meteorological observation started in the 1890s with few meteorological stations. In 1951, meteorological services were established as a small unit in the then Civil Aviation Department to render aeronautical services. Since then, meteorological observation has been expanding over Ethiopia. As the importance of meteorology was realized by other economic sectors, National Meteorological Services Agency (NMSA) was established by the Government Proclamation Number 201/1980. Besides, NMA started seasonal forecasting and advisory service in 1987 for three seasons, namely Belg (February - May), Kiremt (June-September), and Bega (October-January). The primary duty of NMA is to support all country's socio-economic developments by delivering climate services. Moreover, NMA has more than one thousand three hundred conventional Meteorological stations, three hundred automatic weather stations, five AWOS, three air pollution monitoring stations, three upper air stations, one radar, and eleven satellite receiver stations. The government of Ethiopia is determined to eradicate poverty and become a prosperous country by 2030. In this regard, addressing climate variability and change play a pivotal role in achieving this goal. To this effect, NMA is equipping with modern weather observing and monitoring capabilities and improving processing, analyzing, interpreting, and forecasting weather and climate capabilities at a high resolution and accuracy to meet the end-user's demands and effectively support all socio-economic developments of the country. NMA collaborates with all key stakeholders and partners through continuous engagement on climate services. The NFCS, endorsed during the NMA 40th Anniversary, is envisaged to strengthen collaborative co-production between climate services provider (NMA) and climate service beneficiaries institutions (MoWIE, EFCCC, MoA, MoH, and NDRMC). To commemorate its 40th anniversary, NMA has organized a conference with a theme of ""Forty Years of Climate and Weather Services in Ethiopia"" on May 25-26, 2021, at Skylight Hotel, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Generally, three main sessions were held during the conference. These include; Session one: panel discussion and opening ceremony; session two: presentations on the history of NMA and NFCS Ethiopia, official endorsement of NFSC Ethiopia, and certificate wards; and session three: parallel session of four groups and paper presentations on different thematic areas were made. The 40th anniversary was attended by ministers, commissioners, heads of organizations, and representatives from the WMO Africa regional office, international institutes representatives, experts from different organizations, lecturers, researchers, and NMA officials and staff. This document is proceedings of the 40th anniversary, including summaries of the opening session and the presentations.","2021-05-26","2025-10-17 13:56:27","2025-10-30 16:36:32","2025-10-17 13:56:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752206  Publisher: National Meteorology Agency","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\UF6PMCI3\Getachew et al. - 2021 - Proceeding Report of the 40th Anniversary of National Meteorological Agency, Official endorsement of.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121752206","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chapainawabganj, Rajshahi, Naogaon, and Joypurhat are among the climate vulnerable districts within the Barind Tract, which are susceptible to droughts and experience extreme temperatures. These areas are also severely water stressed due to low rainfall, absence of flooding and unique physiography of the soil. The climatic conditions in these districts have impact on agriculture, as well as the overall socio-economic landscape. Furthermore, the Barind Tract is home to a significant proportion of the indigenous population, who face acute poverty and vulnerabilities due to multifaceted problems such as lack of land holding and asset ownership, low education, low social capital, and challenging climatic and environmental conditions. Recognising the vulnerabilities, BRAC has launched the climate adaptive Ultra Poor Graduation (UPG) programme in the above-mentioned districts. The programme aims to elevate the ultra-poor families out of extreme poverty and guide them toward a sustainable livelihood pathway. However, addressing the distinctive environmental, climatic, and socio-economic challenges experienced by the extreme poor in the region are beyond the capacity of the BRAC. In these circumstances, this policy research aims to comprehend the availability government services available for the extreme poor people in these areas and identify the barriers that hinder the access to and utilization of these services. The study employed a qualitative methodology encompassing 13 Focus Group Discussion (FGDs) and 41 Key Informant Interviews (KII), complemented by an extensive literature review. The fieldworks were conducted in 4 upazilas of 4 districts (Chapainawabganj, Rajshahi, Naogaon, and Joypurhat) during September-October 2023.","2024","2025-10-17 16:38:52","2025-10-21 19:06:28","2025-10-16 22:28:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476716","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\4ULF75RK\Abridged-Policy-Research-Barind-Sept-2024.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476716","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Real food prices remain well above the levels of the 1980s and 1990s, slowing progress on poverty reduction (FAO food price index). Crises due to conflict and adverse weather in 2017 put 815 million people at risk of hunger (IFPRI’s 2018 Global Food Policy Report), reversing the prior downward trend, and straining social protection and emergency relief programs. Tensions that surfaced in the international trading system seeded steps toward protectionism in agricultural markets, with negative implications for growth and food security. The US withdrawal from global commitments on climate change and reversal of regulations for environmental protection will slow attainment of global objectives. Young migrants flowing into Europe from countries with lagging job creation triggered renewed attention to agriculture’s contributions to job security as well as food security. Slow progress toward gender equality in developing countries led to increased emphasis on gender research in key development agencies and foundations in 2017.

However, many of these landscapes worldwide are often highly insecure due to unsupportive government policies, agencies, and lack of local collective action. By conducting a network analysis and participatory exercises with district officials and farmers in two communities from Rakai (Uganda) and Lushoto (Tanzania) districts, we studied local perceptions regarding (a) the contribution of natural resources to local farmers’ livelihoods, and how these farmers, in turn, contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of these natural resources, (b) landscape threats and resilience, and (c) major causes of the identified and possible local solutions for mitigating them. The study shows that in the four communities there was very little communication among farmers and that the cooperation between farmers and local and district stakeholders was rather limited. Farmers did not seek much information concerning conservation and use of natural resources and very few of them were aware of the existence of government programs regulating natural resources management. In addition, the study sites were found to be experiencing a progressive degradation of their natural resources. We, therefore, conclude that the creation of spaces for informed, public discussion aimed at making the institutional context more favourable for the creation and coordination of community groups and at enhancing their interaction, would contribute to a wider movement of knowledge and social exchange. This, in turn, could ultimately result in the creation of local initiatives aimed at the conservation of natural resources.","2018","2025-10-17 14:08:44","2025-10-21 19:06:26","2025-10-17 14:08:44","","","","","","","","","","","","United Nations University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476705","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\QGWHJ5HZ\Bedmar Villanueva et al. - 2018 - Perceptions of resilience, collective action and natural resources management in socio-ecological pr.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476705","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Running from 2015 until 2021, PNIA strengthened the system through a combination of institutional reforms, staff training, and competitive research and innovation grants. Peru’s agricultural research spending doubled with the launch of PNIA. As a percentage of AgGDP, agricultural research spending rose from just 0.32 percent in 2014 to around 0.6 percent during 2015–2017. In more recent years, however, this research intensity ratio has slipped again towards 0.4 levels. It is important that the advances made during the PNIA years are not eroded in the absence of viable mechanism to sustain agricultural R&D and innovation on the long run. Most of Peru’s PhD-qualified agricultural researchers are over 60 years old, posing a significant problem for the future conduct and continuity of agricultural research.

Its important role for food security, nutrition, livelihoods, economies, and cultures is not clearly visible in the Agenda 21 declaration. This may partly reflect the state of development of policies for aquaculture compared with its terrestrial counterpart, agriculture, and possibly also because aquaculture production has historically originated from a few key hotspot regions/countries. This review highlights the need for better integration of aquaculture in global food system dialogues. Unpacking aquaculture's diverse functions and generation of values at multiple spatiotemporal scales enables better understanding of aquaculture's present and future potential contribution to the SDGs. Aquaculture is a unique sector that encompasses all aquatic ecosystems (freshwater, brackish/estuarine, and marine) and is also tightly interconnected with terrestrial ecosystems through, for example, feed resources and other dependencies. Understanding environmental, social, and economic characteristics of the multifaceted nature of aquaculture provides for more context-specific solutions for addressing both opportunities and challenges for its future development. This review includes a rapid literature survey based on how aquaculture links to the specific SDG indicators. A conceptual framework is developed for communicating the importance of context specificity related to SDG outcomes from different types of aquaculture. The uniqueness of aquaculture's contributions compared with other food production systems are discussed, including understanding of species/systems diversity, the role of emerging aquaculture, and its interconnectedness with supporting systems. A selection of case studies is presented to illustrate: (1) the diversity of the aquaculture sector and what role this diversity can play for contributions to the SDGs, (2) examples of methodologies for identification of aquaculture's contribution to the SDGs, and (3) trade-offs between farming systems’ contribution to meeting the SDGs. It becomes clear that decision-making around resource allocation and trade-offs between aquaculture and other aquatic resource users needs review of a wide range of established and emergent systems. The review ends by highlighting knowledge gaps and pathways for transformation that will allow further strengthening of aquaculture's role for contributing to the SDGs. This includes identification and building on already existing monitoring that can enable capturing SDG-relevant aquaculture statistics at a national level and discussion of how a cohesive and comprehensive aquaculture strategy, framed to meet the SDGs, may help countries to prioritize actions for improving well-being.","2023-05-10","2025-10-17 14:14:04","2025-10-21 19:06:26","2025-10-17 14:14:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476707  Publisher: Wiley","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\X3YRALDV\Troell et al. - 2023 - Perspectives on aquaculture's contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals for improved human a.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476707","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experiment was conducted at Gudo Beret Kebele in the Basona Worena District, North Shewa Zone, and Amhara regional state from June 2022 to January 2023. Eight nationally released varieties of food and malt barley (Agegnehu-FB, Ibon-MB, Misrach-FB, Holker-MB, Local-FB, HB1964-MB, HB1307-FB, and Hagere-FB) were included in the experiment. The maximum grain yield (4.29 t/ha) was reported by HB1307-FB's food-feed barley, followed by Hagere-FB (4.03 t/ha) and Local-FB (2.27 t/ha). The highest and lowest means were found in the straw yields from HB1307-FB (4.92t/ha) and Ibon-MB (3.13t/ha), respectively. A higher CP content (4.02) was found for the Agegnehu-FB type, while HB1964- MB had a lower CP level. Moreover, it was found that the ADF content in HB1964-MB was lower (51.25%) and higher (53.88%) in Local-FB. In comparison to other food-feed barley cultivars, Agegnehu-FB exhibited the highest degradation (36.61) over the course of the 24-hour incubation period. Furthermore, Ibon-MB demonstrated the greatest degradation and local-FB the lowest after 96 hours of incubation. The component's potential degradability fraction (b) varied from 34.54 to 50.91%. HB1964-MB, Holker-MB, Agegnehu-FB, HB1307-FB, Misrach- FB, Local-FB, Hagere-FB, and Ibon-MB were ranked first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth, respectively, according to the results of the participatory variety selection. In addition to producing more grain for human consumption, the Agegnehu-FB, HB1307-FB, Misrach-FB, Hagere-FB, and Ibon-MB varieties also had the potential to produce better grain, straws, and digestibility, which made them desirable possibilities for food-feed in the study area.

Agricultural products provideenergy, protein, vitamins and minerals and critical to addressing malnutrition, particularlyamong children. Dairy products play a key role in healthy human nutrition and developmentthroughout life especially, in childhood because of the concentrated source of macro andmicronutrients. The aim of this study was to assess nutritional status of children two to fiveyears’ old, cow’s milk consumption pattern and other associated factors. Community basedcross-sectional survey was conducted in Kilteawlaelo district from April to June 2015. A totalof 530 households were included using two stage sampling technique. Mothers/care giverswere interviewed after consent was given to obtain the information on child care and feedingpractices. Anthropometric measurements were used to assess the nutritional status of children2 to 5 years old. Among the 530 sampled children 19% and 81% was living in urban andrural respectively. The prevalence of stunting, underweight and wasting was 43 %, 26 % and10.9 % respectively. The Bivariate analysis, using chi square test revealed that marital status,occasion of soap use for hand washing, sex of care giver, most commonly consumed cereals,father’s occupation and birthplace showed significant association with all three indicators ofundernutrition. The multivariate analysis using multiple logistic regressions modeldemonstrated that age of children and commonly consumed cereals were significant predictorof stunting and underweight; mother’s educational level was significant predictor of wastingand underweight; sex of child, child vaccination status, source of cow milk and mother’soccupation were significant predictor of wasting only; marital status, occasion of soap use,father’s educational level and birthplace were significant predictor of stunting only; and sexof respondent were significant predictor of underweight only. The results of this studyindicate that under nutrition among 2 to 5 years old children is still a problem in Kilteawlaelodistrict.

As investments increase, the objectives of these programs are expanding from focusing on reducing poverty to addressing other social issues such as improving diets and nutrition. At the same time, there is increasing interest in addressing all forms of malnutrition within the framework of food systems. Given the intersections between SAPs and food systems, we reviewed the effectiveness of SAPs (agriculture asset transfers, cash transfers, in-kind transfers, vouchers, public works and school meals programs) for reducing all forms of malnutrition across the lifecycle within a food systems framework. As several programs included multiple treatment arms, each representing a unique program design, we used study arm as the unit of analysis and assessed the proportion of study arms with positive or negative program impacts on diet and nutrition outcomes among men, women and children. The majority of the studies included in this review were from evaluations of agriculture asset, cash and in-kind transfer programs. There was clear evidence of positive impacts on women’s and children’s diet-related outcomes. Very few studies assessed program impact on women’s nutritional status outcomes. However, there was some evidence of impacts on increasing body mass index and hemoglobin concentration (Hb) with in-kind transfer programs. Among children, several study arms across the agriculture asset, cash and in-kind transfer programs found positive impacts on increasing height-for-age Z-score (33%-45% of study arms) and weight-for-height Z-score (33%-50% of study arms) and decreasing the prevalence of wasting (43%-60% of study arms). Cash and in-kind transfer programs also found positive effects on reducing stunting prevalence in 33% and 45% of study arms, respectively. Lastly, a few study arms assessed program impact on increasing Hb with some evidence of positive impacts in in-kind and school feeding programs. There was a paucity of relevant evidence of the effectiveness of voucher and public works programs on diet and nutrition outcomes, for men’s outcomes and on micronutrient status. Several challenges remain in understanding the potential for SAPs to improve diet and nutrition outcomes within food systems including the heterogeneity of program and evaluation designs, populations targeted by the programs and included in evaluations and indicators used to assess impact. Addressing these challenges in future evaluations is important for informing program and actions to improve the effectiveness of SAPs within food systems for improving diet and nutrition outcomes across the lifecycle.","2021-09-30","2025-10-17 13:50:30","2025-10-30 22:42:15","2025-10-17 13:50:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476697  Publisher: International Food Policy Research Institute","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\MTFI25VF\Olney et al. - 2021 - Nutrition-sensitive social protection programs within food systems.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476697; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121378311","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These areas are also where the least evidence exists on how to tackle poverty. This paper investigates whether the Targeting the Ultra Poor program can lift households out of poverty in a fragile context: Afghanistan. In 80 villages in Balkh province, 1,219 of the poorest households were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Women in treatment households received a one-off “big-push” package, including a transfer of livestock assets, cash consumption stipend, skills training, and coaching. One year after the program ended — two years after assets were transferred — significant and large impacts are found across all the primary pre-specified outcomes: consumption, assets, psychological well-being, total time spent working, financial inclusion, and women’s empowerment. Per capita consumption increases by 30 percent (USD 24 purchasing power parity, USD 7 nominal per month) with respect to the control group, and the share of households below the national poverty line decreases from 82 percent in the control group to 62 percent in the treatment group. Using modest assumptions about consumption impacts, the intervention has an estimated internal rate of return of 26 percent, excluding non-monetized improvements in psychological well-being, women’s empowerment, and children’s health and education. These findings suggest that “big-push” interventions can dramatically reduce poverty in fragile and conflict-affected regions.","","2025-10-17 16:13:56","2025-10-21 19:06:23","2025-10-16 23:10:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476694","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\BIZ3IZ2H\No-Household-Left-Behind-Afghanistan-Targeting-the-Ultra-Poor-Impact-Evaluation.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476694","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When they do receive assistance they are rarely able to improve their conditions enough to maintain long-term sustainable livelihoods. Through years of work on poverty alleviation BRAC (the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee) has developed an extremely successful ‘graduation model’. BRAC’s Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction – Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) programme targets the poorest. It combines support for immediate consumption with an asset grant to kick start an economic activity and provides skills training, basic health care assistance and access to financial services. The model gives recipients a 24-month period to develop sustainable livelihoods and ‘graduate’ out of extreme poverty. This paper presents the BRAC programme as a major innovation in our understanding of extreme poverty. The authors also show how the process of ‘graduation’ is fraught with challenges, and how many would always require state level support.","2011","2025-10-16 22:35:39","2025-10-21 19:06:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","CSP Research Report 10","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476691","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\W3RNGDQC\ResearchReport10__FINAL.indd.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476691","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"TEYCAEGY","thesis","2016","Mekuriaw, Getinet","Molecular characterization of Ethiopian indigenous goat populations: Genetic diversity and structure, demographic dynamics and assessment of the kisspeptin gene polymorphism","","","","","https://hdl.handle.net/10568/76315","Ethiopia lies within the earliest geographic center for the dispersal of livestock into the African continent. It therefore comprises a unique repository of livestock genetic diversity in the continent. However, information relating to the origin and divergence of domestic goats in the North-East African region, and Ethiopia in particular, remains unknown despite the availability of genomic tools to assess the same. Here, the complete mitochondrial DNA D-loop region of 309 individuals representing 13 Ethiopian indigenous populations of goats was sequenced to investigate the maternal historical demographic dynamics of Ethiopian indigenous goats. Similarly, genotype data were generated from 14 populations by the 50K Caprine SNP CHIP array to investigate the genetic diversity and structure of Ethiopian indigenous goats. The Chinese Cashmere, Cashmere-Ibex hybrid and the wild Swiss Alpine Ibex populations were also included as outgroup for comparison. In addition, analysis of polymorphism of the KISS1 gene and its association with litter size, and haplotype and patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis were conducted in exon regions of the kisspeptin gene of Gondar and Woyto-Guji goat populations. A total of 173 and 242 Sanger sequences were employed for further analysis of exon1 (1210 bp) and exon2 (325 bp) regions of the kisspeptin gene, respectively. Sequencing of the mtDNA, 174 variable sites that generated 231 haplotypes were observed in the D-loop region of mtDNA sequences and these haplotypes defined two haplogroups lacking a phylogeographic structure but with a high genetic diversity. In a combined analysis of reference haplotypes representing the six globally defined Caprine haplogroups revealed out two haplogroups to be A and G, with the former being the most predominant. The lack of phylogeographic structure and a weak population differentiation (overall FST = 0.0245) suggest extensive gene flow amongst indigenous Ethiopian goats. In the genome wide survey, high genetic diversity (HE ≥ 0.35) but low level of genetic differentiation among the populations is revealed. The 14 populations were grouped into six clusters and none of them was specific to one population or geographic region. Interestingly, population phylogenetic analysis did not support the classification of Ethiopian goats based on their agro-ecological location, associated production system and phenotypic family as suggested previously, but differentiated the Kaffa goat from the rest of 13 Ethiopian goat populations. Based on the admixture and phylogenetic network analyses, the 14 Ethiopian goat populations can be re-grouped into seven goat types. On the other hand, polymorphism analysis of the KISS1 gene revealed five complete substitutions and 15 polymorphic sites in both exon regions. The overall average HE was 0.18863±0.21 for exon1 and 0.03155±0.01 for exon2. Among detected polymorphic sites only four SNPs contributed 18%-31% multiple birth. Similarly, a total of 29 and three haplotypes were detected in exon1 and exon2, respectively. The overall haplotype diversity was 0.8703 for exon1 and 0.0703 for exon2. Lowest (0.083 for Woyto-Guji and 0.081 for Gondar goats) and modest (0.656 for Woyto-Guji and 0.635 for Gondar goats) average estimates of R2 and |D’| were obtained in LD decay analysis in exon1, respectively, and most of the R2 and |D’| values suffer floor and ceiling effects. The neutrality tests showed significant and negative values of FS for Woyto-Guji (FS = -8.098) and for Gondar goats (FS = -12.08); whereas, the Tajima’s D test was positive and non-significant. Overall, there was high goat population dynamics that caused to have highest level of population admixture.","2016-06-30","2025-10-17 14:09:12","2025-10-21 19:06:21","2025-10-17 14:09:12","","","","","","","Molecular characterization of Ethiopian indigenous goat populations","","","","","Addis Ababa University","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476689","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\88DU4I32\Mekuriaw - 2016 - Molecular characterization of Ethiopian indigenous goat populations Genetic diversity and structure.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476689","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We provide a simple model of biased expectations, complementary input use and technology adoption and test its predictions using a field experiment among smallholder maize farmers in eastern Uganda. We find that pointing out the importance of complementary investments using a short, engaging video effectively deters some farmers from using commercial improved varieties.

First edition, March 2024","","","","","https://hdl.handle.net/10568/152234","This sustainable land management (SLM) innovation draws on qualitative formative research, co-design of an innovation with partners, a quantitative impact evaluation testing the innovation, and resulting guidance for partners on implementing the innovation. This project is delivered as part of a multifaceted graduation model social protection program, SPIR II (Strengthen Productive Safety Net Program Institutions and Resilience II) that seeks to further sustain nutrition security and reduce risks to livelihoods for households participating in the Ethiopia’s national safety program, the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), which provides consumption support in the form of cash and food transfers. The goal of the SLM innovation being tested is to leverage social protection to promote women’s engagement in sustainable land management practices. Strengthening women’s involvement in sustainable land management is seen as potentially important given that extreme weather events pose risks for poor households in rural Ethiopia and women may be disproportionately at risk from these shocks. For example, Kato et al (2021) find that plots controlled by women in Ethiopia are more prone to soil erosion and of poorer quality in terms of soil depth, and women’s participation in watershed committees is low. The sustainable land management practices being introduced may help protect women and their families from these shocks over the longer term as well as introduce an additional livelihoods avenue. The innovation tested includes providing training (to either women only or to both men and women from same households) and free inputs (tree seedlings, vegetable seeds and tools for home gardening) among participants of the PSNP public works program, thus helping to address constraints to accessing information and inputs, and assessing whether spousal cooperation is important for successful adoption of these technologies.","2024-03-30","2025-10-17 14:22:11","2025-10-21 19:06:17","2025-10-17 14:22:11","","","","","","","Leveraging social protection for women’s engagement in sustainable land management","","","","","","","en","","","","","cgspace.cgiar.org","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476672  Publisher: CGIAR System Organization","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\EHJX27F7\Gilligan et al. - 2024 - Leveraging social protection for women’s engagement in sustainable land management IPSR Innovation.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121476672","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even during the immense global challenges during to the Covid-19 pandemic, the country’s agricultural sector persisted. Improving on traditional initiatives and practices to address constraints faced by farmers and other agricultural value chain actors will ena ble the sector to expand and benefit new sections of the population, including those most vulnerable such as the poor, women, and youth.

Besides innovations in fi nancial services, there has been a burgeoning list of logistical services as well. Utilizing this wave of innovations appropriately can help the agricultural sector reach its full potential for success. This report is arranged in the following manner.

To do this we conduct a large-scale randomized control trial, covering over 21,000 households in 1,309 villages surveyed four times over a seven year period, to evaluate a nationwide program in Bangladesh that transfers livestock assets and skills to the poorest women. At baseline, the poorest women mostly engage in low return and seasonal casual wage labor while wealthier women solely engage in livestock rearing. The program enables poor women to start engaging in livestock rearing, increasing their aggregate labor supply and earnings. This leads to asset accumulation (livestock, land and business assets) and poverty reduction, both accelerating after four and seven years. These gains do not come at the expense of others: non-eligibles’ livestock rearing businesses are not crowded out and wages received for casual jobs increase as the poor reduce their labor supply in such labor activities. Our results show that: (i) the poor are able to take on the work activities of the non-poor but face barriers to doing so, and, (ii) one-o¤ interventions that remove these barriers lead to sustainable poverty reduction.

We assess whether a social assistance program – the Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI) –influenced the effects of prior monsoon flooding on household consumption and adult diets in southern Bangladesh. TMRI provided cash or food transfers, with or without nutrition behavior change communication, from 2012-2014. Within the study sites and years, flooding was substantial but moderate. Our findings suggest that, without TMRI, a one-standard-deviation increase in lagged flooding led to households smoothing consumption by drawing down savings and reducing diet quality among both men and women. In contrast, among TMRI treatment households, lagged flooding did not reduce savings, and both men’s and women’s diet quality improved. Effects on diet quality appeared largely driven by legumes and by fruits and vegetables, and improvements appeared strongest among households receiving both transfers and behavior change communication. Results indicate that social assistance can help households cope with effects of moderate flooding in southern Bangladesh, protecting household savings and improving both men’s and women’s diets.","2024","2025-10-30 14:43:03","2025-10-17 17:44:01","2025-10-30 14:43:03","","","","","","","Ahmed (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121378353","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121378353","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These offer critical financial lifelines to vulnerable households, aiming to alleviate poverty by providing steady cash support. However, these programs can become long-term fiscal burdens for governments due to limited turnover of recipients, particularly when the programs do not lead to lasting reductions in poverty. To address this problem, economic inclusion programs (including so-called “poverty graduation” programs) are increasingly being introduced as complementary or alternative approaches. Economic inclusion programs aim to provide a cohesive set of mutually reinforcing interventions to help individuals sustainably move out of poverty. Governments are also increasingly interested in seeing if these programs can “graduate” households from relying on cash transfers.","2024","2025-10-30 14:43:03","2025-10-17 17:44:01","2025-10-30 14:43:03","","","","","","","Allen (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121378209","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121378209","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under the background of the widening income gaps in rural areas, the positive role of precise poverty alleviation policy in promoting distribution equity urgently needs to be tested. Using the sample data of 909 rural households in poverty-stricken areas in 2017, this study investigated the impact of precise poverty alleviation policies on distribution equity and its impact mechanism through propensity score matching (PSM) model and ordinary least squares (OLS) model with interactive items. The results show that the precise poverty alleviation policy can effectively improve the disadvantageous position of the poor in income distribution by means of transfer payment and opportunity supply, and greatly improve the sense of fairness in the distribution of the poor. The treatment effects are 4.2% and 0.470, respectively. However, the irrational preference of the poor farmers for transfer payment also arises. Therefore, on the one hand, we should give full play to the governance function of the rural acquaintance society, fully mobilize the poverty-stricken people’s poverty alleviation subjectivity, and improve their irrational preference for transfer payment. On the other hand, we should optimize the distribution structure of poverty alleviation resources and implement differentiated poverty alleviation policies for different types of poverty-stricken families, so as to ensure that precise poverty alleviation policies promote fair distribution and improve the utilization efficiency of poverty alleviation resources. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2020","2025-10-30 14:43:03","2025-10-17 00:20:30","2025-10-30 14:43:03","735-748","","4","42","","","Guan (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121364115","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\RBVWC3T3\Guan R et al. - 2020 - Research on the promotion of poverty alleviation resources input to the distribution justice of pove.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121364115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scholars and development agents have long argued for the importance of access to financial products and services in achieving equitable economic growth and reducing poverty, particularly focusing on women. However, there is a limited understanding of how financial inclusion specifically impacts women’s economic empowerment in Ethiopia, and little evidence regarding the determinants of women’s financial inclusion within the country. This study attempts to address these research gaps. The empirical methods employed in this study include endogenous switching regression and instrumental variable methods. The data used in this study is from the Women’s module of the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The findings reveal a positive and statistically significant impact of financial inclusion on women’s economic empowerment in Ethiopia, indicating that greater access to financial services contributes to improved economic outcomes for women. These findings underscore the importance of collaboration between financial institutions, development agents, and policymakers to implement effective financial inclusion initiatives tailored to the Ethiopian context. Additionally, rigorous evaluation of these interventions is crucial to understand their specific effects and to ensure their successful implementation. By focusing on the Ethiopian case, this study contributes to our understanding of the relationship between financial inclusion and women’s economic empowerment in the country.

The SEP launch targets families receiving conditional cash transfer (CCT) to increase income. Data were obtained using quantitative and qualitative approaches. The respondents were the beneficiaries of the CCT program, and the total population was 1,000 families. Beneficiaries are spread across five locations: West Bandung Regency, Majalengka Regency, Bantul Regency, Semarang Regency, and Jakarta City. The research results show that SEP has a good impact on beneficiary income. Most of the program beneficiaries succeeded in increasing their income after participating in this program, although there are still challenges such as poor coordination between the central and regional governments. This program has succeeded in increasing the capacity of beneficiaries to manage businesses and expanding financial access inclusively. The sustainability of this program is essential to ensure the lives of the beneficiaries. The conclusion is that SEP is an effective business model to increase the welfare of low-income families. Recommendations include the need for regulation and increased coordination between programs. The novelty of this research is that the implementation of financial inclusion is carried out in stages starting from clear targets such as beneficiaries of the CCT program. Lessons learned from implementing SEP in Indonesia can become a reference for similar programs in other countries facing poverty and economic inequality challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-10-30 14:43:03","2025-10-17 00:20:29","2025-10-30 14:43:03","281-304","","","","","","Susantyo (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121356149","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121356149","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multistage sampling technique was employed to randomly select 400 participants and non-participants in the Tolon District. Food security indicators were computed using consumption expenditure on food (Adult equivalent), Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS), and Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). An Endogenous Switching Regression (ESR) model was used to estimate the effects of participation in the LEAP programme on household food security. Findings reveal that participation in the LEAP programme has a positive impact on beneficiaries. The findings show percentage changes in consumption expenditure, HDDS, and a decrease in household food insecurity by 8%, 36%, and 59% respectively.

A mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data analysis and qualitative interviews, was employed to measure the welfare-improving effects of PKH and validate the survey results. The analysis indicates that PKH reduces poverty in Aceh Province, Indonesia. However, several barriers hinder its widespread implementation, including limited program coverage, low population awareness, and the need for improved communication and coordination. The report suggests researching alternative approaches to enhance the effectiveness of PKH's poverty reduction programs. Potential recommendations include expanding the program's scope to reach more beneficiaries, fostering better communication and coordination among stakeholders, and providing comprehensive education about the program's benefits to the community. The study's findings make a valuable contribution to the existing research on poverty alleviation programs and offer insights that can inform policymakers and practitioners about improving the effectiveness of PKH in combating poverty in Aceh, Indonesia and beyond. The study's findings align with the Rational Choice Theory, suggesting that families in the Aceh Province, Indonesia, have made rational decisions to participate in the Family Hope Program due to the perceived benefits, including educational support. The results also support policy feedback theory, indicating that the program's positive impact on poverty alleviation may create a feedback loop, leading to sustained poverty reduction.

In turn, poor childhood development reinforces the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Social protection could break this negative cycle by reducing poverty and addressing biological and psychosocial risk factors. In this study, we examine the effects of a relatively new wave of social protection and anti-poverty interventions--so-called 'graduation programmes'--on psychosocial risk factors in a context of widespread poverty and poor outcomes for children in rural Haiti. Using a mixed-methods approach, we find positive effects on maternal mental health and on children's exposure to harsh corporal punishment. We find no discernible impact on exposure to violence inside and outside of the home, attitudes to child disciplining practices or child stimulation practices. Greater ability to meet children's basic needs and positive support from programme staff contribute to positive effects. The ubiquity of violence, notions of play being replaced with a focus on discipline as babies turn toddlers and women struggling to combine child care with paid work and domestic chores serve as explanations for lack of impact. Findings point to the potential and limitations of social protection and anti-poverty interventions to address pernicious issues such as poor ECD outcomes and highlight the importance of a multi-sectoral approach.","2021","2025-10-30 14:42:58","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-30 14:42:58","","","0","142","","","Roelen (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328986","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\9JZL32ZS\Roelen Keetie Saha, Amrita - 2021 - Pathways to Stronger Futures The Role of Social Protection in Reducing Psychological Risk Factors f.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328986","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Jordan is no exception to this rule. The objective of this study, therefore, is to provide actionable, timely, targeted, and results-based feedback on a given poverty reduction program. Through reliance on sound analysis, the study offers insights and recommendations for poverty reduction in the Kingdom of Jordan while highlighting the impact of Jordan's Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRS) from 2012 to 2020 on selected socioeconomic indicators. The research design is a summative evaluation relying on quantitative analysis. Our quasi-experimental approach has employed a before/after model, which utilizes interrupted time-series and cross-sectional components to evaluate the effect of Jordanian PRS on given economic indicators. We have applied various tests to evaluate our hypotheses, including the Mann-Whitney U test to measure the effectiveness of Jordan's PRS from 2013 to 2015, as well as the Shapiro-Wilk test to gauge normal distribution. Empirical findings on the impact of these poverty reduction programs have been mixed, but our analysis has substantiated the positive impact that PRS from 2012 to 2015 had on the target group. These programs effectively increased the number of families who benefited from the National Aid Fund; they augmented the number of projects aimed at gainful employment that were financed by the Development and Employment Fund; and they increased the number of Jordanian students enrolled in formal education by 2015--impacts which were statistically significant at level (p <= 0.05). The study further established, however, that the implementation of PRS from 2012 to 2020 was notably ineffectual in decreasing the number of seized beggars by 2015--an impact which was not statistically significant at level (p <= 0.05). This latter result, however, requires further study to account for the complex dynamics involved in cash assistance and education. Within the Jordanian context, no such prior study has been conducted which evaluates, through a holistic and results-oriented approach, the impact of Jordan's PRS from 2012 to 2020 on poverty reduction and socioeconomic vulnerability. The work is original, not only in its unique contextual subject matter, but also in its sample, variables tested, and interpretation of results.","2020","2025-10-30 14:42:58","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-30 14:42:58","421-43","","4","12","","","Hummour (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328927","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\3XHVKDYL\Hummour Anan M.

Using data from the China Family Panel Studies, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy to identify the effect of TPA on child human capital. The evidence indicates that TPA significantly enhances beneficiary children's health, cognitive, and non-cognitive abilities. The most substantial improvement is observed in cognitive ability, reaching 49.8 per cent of its standard deviation (0.999). Mechanism tests suggest that TPA achieves these positive outcomes primarily through improving infrastructure, alleviating resource constraints, and enhancing family-process capacity. Specifically, TPA contributes to local infrastructure enhancement to facilitate child human capital development while increasing targeted households' utilization of medical services for their children and promoting educational inputs in children. Moreover, TPA substantially improves parent-child relationships, increases quality time spent together, and considerably reduces mothers' depression in targeted households. A back-of-envelop calculation suggests that exposure to the TPA policy during childhood leads to a 0.562 increase in years of schooling and a 13.1 per cent increase in wages for adults in their twenties.","2025","2025-10-30 14:42:55","2025-10-30 22:41:50","2025-10-30 14:42:55","256-71","","2","61","","","Du (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121326578","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\SRD6WCCR\Du Baorui Shi, Xiaojun, Qin, Guoqing - 2025 - Children Are the Riches of the Poor The Possibility of Transgenerational Impacts of China's Targete.pdf","","Cognitive Ability; Targeted poverty alleviation; Child human capital; family process; transgenerational effect","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121326578; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294790","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results from a quasi-experimental design show that TASAF targets poor households and does have an impact within its own sphere. However, the said impact does not spill over outside TASAF domain. These results are corroborated by qualitative data findings used in the study. We thus recommend that TASAF be accompanied by similar programs for a bigger and sustainable impact on women's empowerment to be realized.

However, very few look at other collateral effects, such as the incidence of violence. Between 2009 and 2014, El Salvador implemented the Temporary Income Support Program (PATI), which aimed at guaranteeing a temporary minimum level of income to extremely poor urban families for 6 months, as well as providing beneficiaries with experience in social and productive activities at the municipal level. Making use of a panel data set at the municipal level for 2007-2014, with monthly data on different types of crime rates and social program benefits by municipalities, this paper assesses the effects of the program on crime rates in municipalities in El Salvador. There are several possible channels through which the PATI can affect crime. Since the program is associated with cash transfers to beneficiaries, a decrease in economically motivated crimes is expected (income effect). But since the program enforces work requirements and community participation, this could generate a negative impact on crime, because the beneficiaries will have less time to commit crime and because of community deterrence effects. Overall, the paper finds a robust and significant negative impact of the PATI on most types of crimes in the municipalities with the intervention. Moreover, the negative effects of the program on some types of crime rates hold several years after participation. The positive spillover effects for municipalities hold within a radius of 50 km.","2021","2025-10-30 14:42:55","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-30 14:42:55","1778-93","","3","25","","","Acosta (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328435","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\5EY5X7AD\Acosta Pablo Monsalve Montiel, Emma - 2021 - Public Works Programs and Crime Evidence for El Salvador.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328435","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The work assumes that the variable Pronaf does not directly affect poverty and it does so from the variation of income and/or changes in income distribution. The literature review indicated that an increase in per capita income and a decrease in the Gini coefficient lead to a reduction of rural poverty, and a positive change in Pronaf credits leads to an increase in per capita household income and a decrease in the income concentration. The estimates for rural Brazilian indicate that: i) the increase in per capita income or decrease in income inequality tend to reduce poverty; ii) the effect of Pronaf on the average per capita income and income inequality is conditioned by the socioeconomic specifics of observation units, and iii) the expenses of Pronaf tend to indirectly reduce poverty by increasing the average income of farmers and reducing the income concentration.","2014","2025-10-30 14:42:53","2025-10-16 22:32:27","2025-10-30 14:42:53","1-20","","Supplemen","52","","","Batista (2014)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121304695","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\AWCCLIVZ\Batista Henrique Rogê, Neder, Henrique Dantas - 2014 - Efeitos do Pronaf Sobre a Pobreza Rural no Brasil (2001-2009).pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121304695","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Third phase of CDSP (CDSP III) was implemented during 2005-2010 in Boyer Char of Noakhali district, by six government agencies and five local NGOs. BRAC coordinated the interventions of these local NGOs. This study aimed to evaluate CDSP III through assessment of indicators like employment, asset holding (natural, physical and financial), housing condition, education, food security, and crisis coping mechanism. Cross-sectional data collected in 2010 on both participants (from the programme area) and non-participants (from nearby char, which was not under project intervention) were used. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) technique was used for data analysis. The findings showed substantial improvement in livelihoods of the participant households in terms of food security, income, housing condition, asset holding, etc. Although CDSP had no built in education component, out of its own initiatives, BRAC education programme had established some nonformal primary schools in the area. However, findings showed only a modest impact on education. Enrolment rates were found to be very low, even less than the rate prevalent among the ultra poor. The number of educational institutions available were found to be inadequate for the requirement of the residents in the locality. For achieving sustainable livelihood improvement, the importance of education is inevitable; thus, further and innovative interventions, especially in the form of more educational institutions, by both public and private sectors are required. These new interventions, together with the existing programme components, can be expected to improve the livelihood of the char dwellers substantially.","2011","2025-10-30 14:42:52","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 14:42:52","1-36","","","","","","Raza (2011)","","","","Working Paper","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295976      DOI: no DOI","","","","Food Security; Livelihood; Char Dwellers","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295976","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By 2009, two decades of war and widespread displacement left the majority of the population of Northern Uganda impoverished. Methods. This study used a cluster-randomized design to test the hypothesis that a poverty alleviation program would improve economic security and reduce symptoms of depression in a sample of mostly young women. Roughly 120 villages in Northern Uganda were invited to participate. Community committees were asked to identify the most vulnerable women (and some men) to participate. The implementing agency screened all proposed participants, and a total of 1800 were enrolled. Following a baseline survey, villages were randomized to a treatment or wait-list control group. Participants in treatment villages received training, start-up capital, and follow-up support. Participants, implementers, and data collectors were not blinded to treatment status. Results. Villages were randomized to the treatment group (60 villages with 896 participants) or the wait-list control group (60 villages with 904 participants) with an allocation ration of 1:1. All clusters participated in the intervention and were included in the analysis. The intent-to-treat analysis included 860 treatment participants and 866 control participants (4.1% attrition). Sixteen months after the program, monthly cash earnings doubled from UGX 22 523 to 51 124, non-household and non-farm businesses doubled, and cash savings roughly quadrupled. There was no measurable effect on a locally derived measure of symptoms of depression. Conclusions. Despite finding large increases in business, income, and savings among the treatment group, we do not find support for an indirect effect of poverty alleviation on symptoms of depression.","2016","2025-10-30 14:42:52","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 14:42:52","","","","3","","","Green (2016)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295954","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\WFR3XIRY\Green Eric P et al. - 2016 - Does Poverty Alleviation Decrease Depression Symptoms In Post-Conflict Settings A Cluster-Randomize.pdf","","Poverty; Africa; Field Experiment; Depression; Cash Transfers","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295954","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Will lower youth unemployment and poverty reduce the risk of social instability? We experimentally evaluate one of Uganda's largest development programs, which provided thousands of young people nearly unconditional, unsupervised cash transfers to pay for vocational training, tools, and business start‐up costs. Mid‐term results after two years suggest four main findings. First, despite a lack of central monitoring and accountability, most youth invest the transfer in vocational skills and tools. Second, the economic impacts of the transfer are large: hours of nonhousehold employment double and cash earnings increase by nearly 50% relative to the control group. We estimate the transfer yields a real annual return on capital of 35% on average. Third, the evidence suggests that poor access to credit is a major reason youth cannot start these vocations in the absence of aid. Much of the heterogeneity in impacts is unexplained, however, and is unrelated to conventional economic measures of ability, suggesting we have much to learn about the determinants of entrepreneurship. Finally, these economic gains result in modest improvements in social stability. Measures of social cohesion and community support improve mildly, by roughly 5 to 10%, especially among males, most likely because the youth becomes a net giver rather than a net taker in his kin and community network. Most strikingly, we see a 50% fall in interpersonal aggression and disputes among males, but a 50% increase among females. Neither change seems related to economic performance nor does social cohesion ‐ a puzzle to be explored in the next phase of the study. These results suggest that increasing access to credit and capital could stimulate employment growth in rural Africa. In particular, unconditional and unsupervised cash transfers may be a more effective and cost‐efficient form of large‐scale aid than commonly believed. A second stage of data collection in 2012 will collect longitudinal economic impacts, additional data on political violence and behavior, and explore alternative theoretical mechanisms.","2012","2025-10-30 14:42:52","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 14:42:52","","","","","","","Blattman (2012)","","","","DIW Berlin Discussion Papers","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296070      DOI: No DOI","","","","Randomized Control Trial; Cash Grant; Credit Constraints; Psychological And Social Impacts","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296070","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Impact assessment studies on the first phase of CFPR (2002-06) have shown that the programme had significant positive impacts on the livelihoods of the participant households. However, whether this impact on livelihoods is sustainable or not remained the key research question. Based on panel data from three rounds of survey (2002, 2005 and 2008), this study explores sustainability of livelihood impacts of the first phase of CFPR. The findings show that programme impacts on income, employment, food security and asset holding were mostly sustainable in the long-run. Magnitude of impact on per capita income was found to be increased over time. Livestock and poultry holding increased substantially among the programme participants due to mainly transfer of these assets by the programme and the increase sustained in the long-run. The findings of this study also show that although the programme did not have significant impact on education in the short-run, in the long-run it had a modest positive impact on boysâ€™ primary enrolment. Qualitative exploration reveals that determination, confidence, social network, asset management skill, and hard work of the participant women are the key factors for effectively using the supports provided by the CFPR programme.","2010","2025-10-30 14:42:52","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 14:42:52","","","","","","","Das (2010)","","","","CFPR-TUP Working Paper Series","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296050      DOI: no DOI","","","","Bangladesh; Livelihoods; Poverty Reduction; Sustainable; Boys' Primary Enrolment; Livestock And Poultry","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296050","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Ghana project ran from May 2012 until December 2016, with interventions targeting a cluster of 35 communities with the aim of achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – eight globally endorsed targets that address the problems of poverty, health, gender, equality and disease. This is the first Millennium Village (MV) to be accompanied by an independent impact evaluation, and the findings have broader appeal to those seeking to address the root causes of extreme poverty by taking a holistic, community-led approach to sustainable development – such as the Earth Institute’s Centre for Sustainable Development, which aims to translate the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into meaningful policies and solutions.The MVP has been designed to demonstrate how an integrated approach to development can translate the international MDGs into results, and sustainably address extreme poverty.

This paper investigates the performance of the UNDP multidimensional poverty index (global MPI) and of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) indicators in the impact evaluation of the SADA-Northern Ghana Millennium Village Project (MVP). We find that the project had a limited impact on MDG indicators and yet a large impact on the global MPI. We assess the robustness of the impact of MVP on the global MPI and we find that this was largely driven by changes in few MDG indicators.

Exploiting a regression discontinuity design, this paper tests whether the adoption of a development approach to refugee assistance in a new settlement in Kenya has a positive impact. We find that refugees benefiting from the new approach have better diets and perceive themselves as happier and more independent from humanitarian aid. We find no effect on assets and employment. These effects appear to be driven by the switch from food rations to cash transfers and by the wider promotion of small-scale agriculture. Our findings argue in favor of the development approach to refugee assistance, which is cheaper and leads to better outcomes.","2021","2025-10-30 14:42:51","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 14:42:51","","","","149","","","MacPherson (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295491","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\68WITXKF\MacPherson Claire and Sterck Olivier - 2021 - Empowering refugees through cash and agriculture A regression discontinuity design.pdf","","Cash transfers; Refugees; Self-reliance; Humanitarian Aid; Kakuma; Kalobeyei","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295491","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assessing the effectiveness of these dollars is necessary to measure program success and to allocate such funds among competing projects. This study measures the impact of the first phase of the Cocoa Livelihood Program (CLPI), a current World Cocoa Foundation project sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The project seeks to improve the livelihood of over 200,000 small cocoa producers in Sub-Saharan Africa via training, crop diversification and farmer based organizations. Using data collected from 2,048 pre and post CLPI interviews of cocoa producers in Ghana, Cote d’ivoire, Nigeria and Cameroon, the economic impact of the CLPI program can be estimated. The results show that yield enhancements attributable to CLPI are 36%, 38%, 49% and 24% in Ghana, Côte D’Ivoire, Nigeria and Cameroon, respectively. Using a total program cost of $158-$200 per beneficiary and estimated annual benefits of $86-$152 per beneficiary over 25 years, the benefit- cost ratios were estimated to range from $13 to $22 for every dollar spent on human capital development.","2015","2025-10-30 14:42:51","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 14:42:51","","","","","","","Tsiboe (2015)","","","","Not applicable","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295277      DOI: 10.22004/ag.econ.195775","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\ANZSE4MS\Tsiboe Francis et al. - 2015 - Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Cocoa Livelihoods Program in Sub-Saharan Africa.pdf","","Sub-Saharan Africa; capital development; Cocoa Livelihood Program (CLPI); yield enhancements","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295277","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multistage sampling technique was adopted to select a representative sample for the study. Majority (71.8%) of the participants were male, while 28.2% were female. About 67.9% of the non-participants were male while 32.1% were female. The mean age of the respondents in the study is about 50yrs. Majority (55.3%) of the respondents sourced their farm inputs through the agro-dealers. The Probit regression model was used to examine the factors that influenced the farmers' participation in the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme. The results show that farmers association, Participation in past programme and access to credit were statistically significant at 1%, 1% and 10% level of significance respectively in influencing the farmers' decision in participating in the GES Scheme. The marginal effect shows that the probability of participating in the GESS by a farmer was reduced by 34.5 percent if the farmer was a member of farmers' association, this was quite against the a priori expectation of the study. Also, the results from the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) analysis reveal that the Impact of the GESS exerts a positive impact on the farmers' on-farm income. While the ATE estimates from the PSM analysis suggest that GESS participation increased the farmers' on-farm income by N119, 927.05 ($399.98). This indicates the average change in farmers' income who participated in the Scheme. The study further revealed that Growth Enhancement Support Scheme had a positive Impact on the On-Farm Income of Cassava and Maize Farmers in the Study Area. This suggests that productivity-enhancing agricultural innovations can contribute to raising the income of farming households, improve poverty alleviation and food security in Nigeria and other developing countries of the world. It was therefore recommended that farmers should be encouraged or advised to form associations or put themselves in groups in order to increase their likelihood of participation in this Scheme or subsequent programmes and credit should also be made available in form of soft loan to enhance their access to this subsidized farm inputs.

Economic theory would suggest that benefits of area-based programs would be capitalized into land prices, as supply is relatively fixed compared to other factors of production. While revealed preference methods have been applied widely in the field of environmental economics, they have not yet been used to evaluate an international development project. We study the effects of The Millennium Villages Project (MVP) in Sauri, Kenya. Using administrative data from the Kenyan government on prices for land bought and sold within the MVP (established in 2005) and for land bought and sold in the surrounding area during 1999–2013, we estimate the project's effect on local land prices. We find no evidence that the MVP investments led to an increase in land prices within project areas. This research represents the first work to use hedonic analysis of land values to assess an international development project.","2018","2025-10-30 14:42:51","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 14:42:51","377-387","","","101","","","Michelson (2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295512","","","","Africa; Kenya; impact evaluation; program evaluation; land markets; millennium villages project","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295512","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this study aims to assess the effects of the PRP in health services utilization (both inpatient and outpatient services) among the central and western rural poor of China. Methods: The study conducted household survey and applied propensity score matching (PSM) method to assess the effects of the PRP on health services utilization among the rural poor of Central and Western China. A sensitivity test was also performed on the PSM results to test their robustness. Results: Key findings showed 17.6% of respondents were the beneficial of PRP. The average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) of the PRP on the inpatient visits within one year was found significantly positive (P = 0.026). Conclusion: There has been relationship between PRP with medical financial assistance and reduction of inequality in health services utilization by the poorer, in particular to accessing the inpatient services from the county or township hospitals of China.

What is the impact of these programmes, and do they offer a sustained pathway out of ultra-poverty? In this paper we examine these questions using experimental data from two unconditional cash transfer programmes implemented by the Government of Zambia. We find far-reaching effects of these two programmes, not just on their primary objective, food security and consumption, but also on a range of productive and economic outcomes. After three years, we observe that household spending is 59 per cent larger than the value of the transfer received, implying a sizeable multiplier effect.

Many institutions, including the World Food Programme (WFP), have increasingly used the concept as a basis for their programming. WFP's integrated packages of interventions aim to improve food security and nutrition by smoothing food consumption in the short-term, while supporting livelihoods and addressing barriers to development (e.g., better climate information, access to markets, education, WASH, etc.) in the long-term. While all programme activities are potentially important for building resilience, livelihood activities are clearly connected to both immediate and future wellbeing. These activities include cash or in-kind transfers to the household and support for creating assets that could benefit the household or the community in the future. Therefore, livelihood activities have the potential to support households in improving and maintaining their wellbeing when facing future shocks and stressors.This pre-analysis plan describes policy experiments to estimate the impacts of experimentally varying WFP's activities on resilience as measured by community and household wellbeing. This approach follows others in conceptualizing resilience through changes in wellbeing (Knippenberg et al, 2019, Phadera et al. 2019, Jones and Tanner, 2017; Barrett et al, 2020). We design and run these experiments in the context of livelihoods programs implemented by the World Food Programme (WFP) across 6 countries. Beyond testing the overall impact of livelihood activities on wellbeing, a key ambition of this paper is to investigate whether activities themselves can be timed to accommodate households’ vulnerability to seasonal fluctuations and shocks that are often connected to weather patterns and agricultural cycle. We identify two such mechanisms: adjusting the timing of cash transfers and labor requirements; and/or allowing for re-targeting participants over time to account for changes in vulnerability status.","2022","2025-10-30 14:42:50","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 14:42:50","","","","","","","Christian (2022)","","","","Not specified","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295126      DOI: 10.1257/rct.6851-3.1","","","","Resilience; Welfare; Shocks; Social protection; Environment & Energy","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Actually, since the inception of democratic rule, the South African government has turned to social grants to address the issues of poverty, income inequality and to improve household welfare. The coverage of social grants has increased substantially with more than 17 million (about 34% of the population) South Africans being recipients of social grants. Despite having relatively well-developed social security system, poverty levels in rural parts of South Africa remains very high. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses a cross-sectional households survey data conducted in Hlokozi village. A propensity score matching technique, which accounts for non-random selection of households, is applied. Findings – The results reveal that social grants have a significant and positive impact on rural household welfare. Specifically, the nearest neighbour matching estimates suggest that the causal effect for social grants on household welfare is the region of about R5,830. Consistent with the nearest neighbouring method, the results obtained using the Kernel matching method show that social grants are significant in improving rural household welfare. Originality/value – While there are a number of studies that have shed some light on how social grant reduces poverty in South Africa, there are some gaps. Firstly, only a few studies have interrogated the impact of social grants on household welfare. Secondly, most of these studies have relied on descriptive analysis, and finally, besides poverty being high in rural areas, research on the impact of social grants on rural household welfare remains thin.","2022","2025-10-30 14:42:41","2025-10-30 22:41:49","2025-10-30 14:42:41","","","","","","","Zwane (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294975","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\6LR6QJLP\Zwane Talent et al. - 2022 - Assessing the Impact of Social Grants on Household Welfare Using Propensity Score Matching Approach.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121301107; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294975","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Taking resilience as a household’s ability to adapt to their environments, absorb shocks and stressors, and transform their capacities, this impact evaluation combines detailed baseline and follow-up data, covering broad household capacities, with high-frequency data, measuring food security and well-being dynamics. The evaluation uses a robust randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to compare households in villages that implemented the integrated resilience programming to other similar villages where the programming was not delivered. The evaluation finds that the programme moderately increases food security and subjective well-being after two years. The investigation of the adaptations that households made during this period to achieve these impacts, found that households intensified their participation in the most common livelihoods in these areas. Specifically, the impact evaluation shows an increase in land area cultivated and in the production of agricultural staple crops. These effects are most concentrated among relatively poorer households eligible for FFA and LSS, and in the primary villages closest to the FFA sites where assets were built or land restored. This is consistent with assets (and not just cash transfers) contributing to the observed impacts on agricultural production.&nbsp;","2024","2025-10-30 14:42:41","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 14:42:41","","","","","","","Premand (2024)","","","","United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294841      DOI: No DOI","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\XW4GPE7Z\WFP-0000160664.pdf","","Nutrition; Food Assistance; School Feeding Program; Smallholder Agriculture Market Support (SAMS)","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294841","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use the Tanzanian 2017–18 Household Budget Survey dataset, comprising 9,463 households, to evaluate the impact of the productive social safety net (PSSN) program on households’ vulnerability to food insecurity (VFI). The VFI is evaluated using the vulnerability as expected poverty (VEP) approach, whereas the impact is estimated using the Instrumental Variable (IV) approach. We found evidence consistent with the significant impact of PSSN on the VFI. Curiously, the estimated impacts are greater for households enrolled in conditional cash transfer (CCT) and public works (PW) combined, implying that a package of CCT and PW is likely to have a greater impact on vulnerability reduction space. Overall, the results provide evidence in support of policies that encourage wider expansion of SSNs as a policy instrument for assisting extremely poor households in moving out of the chronically poor and the risk of falling or remaining food insecure in the future.","2024","2025-10-30 14:42:41","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 14:42:41","","","1","12","","","Msuha (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294794","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\NADRTS3Q\Msuha Basil and Kissoly Luitfred D - 2024 - Impact of Productive Social Safety Net on Households’ Vulnerability to Food Insecurity in Tanzania.pdf","","TANZANIA; Instrumental Variables; Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT); Public Works Program; Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN); Vulnerability as Expected Poverty; Vulnerability to food insecurity","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294794","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether the implementation of the targeted poverty-alleviation policy has narrowed the urban-rural income gap, along with its specific effects, requires an accurate analysis, which is particularly critical in order for China to implement a rural-revitalization strategy and further eliminate relative poverty in the future. Given the problems and shortcomings of the existing studies, such as not passing the parallel trend test to overestimate the policy effect, in this study we refer to the previous results, and our analyses divide the 124 counties in Yunnan province into four categories: non-poverty counties and counties with grade-I, grade-II, and grade-III poverty. We selected the panel data of the urban-rural income ratio of each county along with eight influencing factors from 2011 to 2020 for difference-in-difference model (DID) analysis. In this study, we compare the four types of counties level-by-level, and we construct a full-sample spatial DID model. The estimated results, after excluding the impact of COVID-2019, are significant. In addition, we perform robustness and placebo tests and other work on the DID model. All of the results show that the implementation of the targeted poverty-alleviation policy has effectively reduced the urban-rural income ratio in areas experiencing poverty. Finally, we use the intermediary effect analysis method to explore the reasons for the findings: driven by the targeted poverty-alleviation policy, the financial investment in poor areas has substantially increased, further increasing the income level of rural residents in poor areas and thus promoting a notable reduction in the income gap between urban and rural residents in poor areas. We suggest that, although China has achieved comprehensive success in targeted poverty-alleviation, assistance investment still needs to be increased, policies must be adjusted, and income growth must be accelerated to achieve industrial prosperity.","2022","2025-10-30 14:42:41","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 14:42:41","","","19","14","","","Yang (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295066","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\ZAV2KJ8G\Yang Ren Yi et al. - 2022 - Analysis on the Effect of the Targeted Poverty Alleviation Policy on Narrowing the Urban-Rural Incom.pdf","","Difference-in-difference model; intermediary effect; Poverty Classification; Targeted Poverty-Alleviation; Urban–Rural Income Gap","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295066","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we aimed to estimate the project's impact, target attainment, and on-site spending.MethodsIn this endline evaluation of the MVP, we retrospectively selected comparison villages that best matched the project villages on possible confounding variables. Cross-sectional survey data on 40 outcomes of interest were collected from both the project and the comparison villages in 2015. Using these data, as well as on-site spending data collected during the project, we estimated project impacts as differences in outcomes between the project and comparison villages; target attainment as differences between project outcomes and prespecified targets; and on-site spending as expenditures reported by communities, donors, governments, and the project. Spending data were not collected in the comparison villages.FindingsAveraged across the ten project sites, we found that impact estimates for 30 of 40 outcomes were significant (95% uncertainty intervals [UIs] for these outcomes excluded zero) and favoured the project villages. In particular, substantial effects were seen in agriculture and health, in which some outcomes were roughly one SD better in the project villages than in the comparison villages. The project was estimated to have no significant impact on the consumption-based measures of poverty, but a significant favourable impact on an index of asset ownership. Impacts on nutrition and education outcomes were often inconclusive (95% UIs included zero). Averaging across outcomes within categories, the project had significant favourable impacts on agriculture, nutrition, education, child health, maternal health, HIV and malaria, and water and sanitation. A third of the targets were met in the project sites.

Mixed-methods evidence from Malawi","","","","","https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/228836","The primary objective of social protection is to fight poverty and food insecurity. However, there are good theoretical arguments to support the idea that it can also contribute to more complex outcomes, such as social cohesion. This paper investigates the effects of the Tingathe Economic Empowerment Programme (TEEP) in Malawi on three key pillars of social cohesion, namely inclusive identity, trust and cooperation. The TEEP is a multi-component social protection scheme, which targets ultra-poor and labor-constrained households. It provides three randomly selected groups of beneficiaries with three different packages: a lump-sum transfer, a financial and business training connected to the creation of saving (VSL) groups, and a combination of both.

We provide evidence on this issue by looking at the effects of a large-scale asset transfer and training programme which is targeted at the poorest women in rural Bangladesh. We use a randomized control trial research design, and survey all households in the community. This allows us to map the full social network of the beneficiaries, on multiple dimensions of interaction. We find that beneficiaries' wealth levels and occupational structure converge to that of lower-middle class households. Beneficiaries use their newly found wealth to purchase household durables, and improve their human capital, as measured by business skills and their health status. We find the programme affects the composition of beneficiary households' networks: they form ties to wealthier residents after the programme. The programme also affects outcomes among social network members, but has no effect on households that are not socially connected to beneficiaries. Our findings suggest that such programs have effects beyond beneficiary households, and that the network structures and outcomes in targeted communities are transformed by them.","2009","2025-10-30 14:42:41","2025-10-16 09:32:59","2025-10-30 14:42:41","","","","","","","Bandiera (2009)","","","","LSE STICERD Working Paper Series","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058352      DOI: no DOI","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\K4M44S6G\121058352.pdf","","Asset Transfers; Social Networks; Ultra-Poor Programme","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058352","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In South Africa, social grants and the use of wild foods have been reported as some ways to improve household food insecurity and reduce poverty. The study examined if social grants and consumption of wild foods alleviate food insecurity in South Africa. Household surveys and focus group discussions were conducted along the rural-urban continuum in three South African towns situated along an agro-ecological gradient. We explored the differences in household food security indicators, mean monthly food expenditure and wealth index between households receiving social grants, households consuming wild foods, and those who did not. Households receiving social grants were more food insecure with lower mean monthly food expenditure and wealth index than those who did not. Overall all towns, the use of wild foods improved household food security which was not true within towns where wild foods were mostly consumed by low income and more food insecure households. Social grants alone cannot eradicate food insecurity as the money is not enough to cater for all household needs whilst wild foods can potentially alleviate household food insecurity. As food prices continue to increase gradually and worsening household food insecurity, ways to shift 'income circumstances' of households and promote the use and consumption of wild foods which may increase dietary diversity and diversifying food access. Focus should be placed on capacity building, employment creation and promoting awareness on own food production which is one way to improve food security of poor households rather than depending on purchases from the grant money alone.","2019","2025-10-30 14:42:55","2025-10-30 14:43:37","2025-10-30 14:42:55","87-94","","C","13","","","Chakona (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121326057","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121326057","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the sector is faced with many challenges, rural households are compelled to develop strategies through diversification to cope with the increasing vulnerability associated with agricultural production. As a result, the purpose of this research is to assess the impact of livelihood diversification on household poverty in the Jimma zone of Ethiopia's Oromia regional state. A multistage sampling procedure was employed to select 385 sample household heads. The study utilized data obtained from a cross-sectional survey using an interview schedule, focus group discussion, key informant interview, and personal observations. Both descriptive and econometric data analysis techniques were applied. The result of the FGT poverty measure revealed that the incidence of poverty among rural households was 37.14%, implying that 62.86% were non-poor. The descriptive statistics revealed that age of household, dependency ratio, year of schooling, sex of household, livestock ownership, landholding, non-farm income, market distance, and extension contact were found to have a significant influence on the poverty status of a household at different probability levels. Based on the cost of basic needs approach, it was applied to measure poverty status. The results of the logit model indicate that family size, landholding, livestock ownership, year of schooling, access to credit services, and off-farm income of the households were found to have significantly determined livelihood diversification. Moreover, the results of the propensity score matching indicate that household participation in livelihood diversification has a positive and significant impact on household poverty. Accordingly, households with diversified livelihoods were found to be 9% better off than those that were not diversified in terms of poverty. Policies aimed at increasing the income generation ability of the household should be strongly considered. Therefore, to ensure the capacity of rural households to practice farming along with a wide range of income-generating activities to improve the well-being of the rural poor and have a significant impact on poverty reduction, participating in livelihood diversification should be given emphasis in development planning.","2021","2025-10-30 14:42:58","2025-10-30 14:43:35","2025-10-30 14:42:58","","","3894610","2021","","","Abebe (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121354173","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\K7HQ3IT7\Abebe Tsehaynesh Chalchisa, Tamiru, Eneyew, Adugna - 2021 - The impact of rural livelihood diversification on household poverty evidence from Jimma zone, Oromi.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121354173","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is shown that rural economic resilience is connected with their resistance, adaptation, and transformation capabilities, and China's targeted poverty alleviation policies have significantly improved the economic resilience of villages because of the government's efforts to upgrade production factors, optimise the economic structure and expand rural functions have awakened the impetus of endogenous development in rural areas. Compared with resistance and transformability, poverty alleviation policies have a greater positive impact on the adaptability of rural economies. The explanatory power of poverty alleviation policies on the rural economic resilience of Lankao County shows obvious spatial differentiation. The effectiveness of poverty alleviation policies was more prominent in the southeast, where poverty was worse.

Studies have sought to understand how poverty reduction and intersectoral programming targeted to adolescents can facilitate safe transitions to adulthood among adolescents. However, most intersectoral interventions for adolescents to date have been implemented by non-governmental actors with limited generalizability and potential for scale-up. In the current study, we examine 22-month post intervention impacts of the ""plus components"" of a cash plus intervention, Ujana Salama (Swahili for ""Safe Youth"") targeted to adolescents ages 14-19 years (males and females) in households participating in a government social protection program in Tanzania. The government-implemented cash plus intervention, comprised of livelihoods and life skills training, a productive grant, mentoring, and linkages to adolescent-friendly health services, was implemented over 18 months in 2018 and 2019. Methods: Using a cluster randomized controlled trial, we estimated post-intervention impacts in 2021 on the following domains: relationships, modern contraception, health seeking and HIV knowledge and risk, psychosocial outcomes and attitude, and violence. We further examined whether contextual factors, including gender norms and quality of health services, moderated these post-intervention impacts. Results: Few impacts found at earlier rounds were still evident post-intervention. Exceptions include protective impacts on lifetime sexual violence risk among females and increases in sexual and reproductive health services utilization among males. Moreover, newly detected adverse impacts on mental health contrasted with earlier protective impacts. Conclusion: While external factors such as lengthy delays of cash transfer payments to adolescents' households and the COVID-19 pandemic may have mitigated the potential for sustained impacts of this intervention, findings suggest that future programs may need to provide different combinations of programming, provide support longer-term, or intervene at more levels of the social ecological model to influence many of the outcomes examined and to effect more lasting change.","2025","2025-10-30 14:42:58","2025-10-30 14:43:34","2025-10-30 14:42:58","","","","29","","","Waidler (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121346575","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121346575","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using repeated measures at five-time points (baseline, years 1, 2, 3 and 4-post baseline) across two study arms: treatment (receiving the EE intervention) vs. control arm (not receiving EE), we find that both the incidence and proportion of multidimensional poverty decreased in the treatment arm vs. the control arm. Given that there is a direct link between economic instability and poor health outcomes, these findings are informative.

However, the interventions impacts remain less understood. We assessed the impact of the Urban Program on Livelihoods and Income Fortification and Socio-civic Transformation (UPLIFT) project on QoL, psychological wellbeing, self-esteem, and the quality of neighbourhood social environment of young people aged 13-25 years in slum areas of Makindye and Nakawa Divisions in Kampala, Uganda. Methods: The study was designed as a mixed method evaluation using repeated cross-sectional survey and grounded theory in both the intervention and comparison communities. The intervention effect was estimated using the difference-in-differences Kernel propensity-score matching technique, with bootstrapping. The ""rcs"" option was used given that data were from repeated cross-sectional surveys. A thematic analysis was adopted for the qualitative data to triangulate and complement the quantitative data. Results: The UPLIFT project led to an improvement in QoL, psychological wellbeing, and self-esteem of young people. In terms of QoL, the project led to a six-percentage point increase in quality of living conditions scores (where higher scores reflect better living conditions; lower ones, worse living conditions). However, a negative effect was observed for personal independence whilst the project did not have any impact on social relations. In terms of self-esteem and psychological wellbeing, the project led to a 4.6-point increase in self-esteem scores, a 5.4-point increase in self-acceptance scores, a 5.3- point increase in purpose in life scores, a 5.7 - point increase in personal growth, and a 10.7-point increase in autonomy scores. However, the project had a negative effect on personal independence; and had no impact on environmental mastery and the quality of neighbourhood social environment. Conclusion: Functional community-owned assets accumulation and capacity building initiatives for young people in slum areas improved their psychological wellbeing and quality of life.

Although social grants have been found to reduce poverty and promote human development, considerable uncertainty remains about some of their incentive effects. This study uses a sample of 984 rural households selected from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to investigate the potential incentive/dis-incentive effects of social grant-dependency on rural households’ participation in farming activities. The data are analysed using the generalised propensity score (GPS) matching method and ordinary least squares. The results showed that the effect of social-grant dependency on households’ farm participation levels varies at different dependency levels. While social grants had a negative effect on the households’ farming participation levels when social grants income contribute 20–60 %, they had a positive effect at lower (&lt; 20 %) and higher (&gt; 60 %) dependency levels. The positive effect of social grants at the lower and higher levels supports the hypothesis that social grant beneficiaries use part of the grant income to alleviate financial constraints in agricultural production. However, the negative effect at the 20–60 % dependency levels is consistent with the dis-incentive hypothesis, suggesting that social grants may generate dis-incentives to farm production. The study identified several policy variables that affect the participation of rural households in smallholder farming activities, highlighting the importance of expectations of farming success as a key motivator.","2017","2025-10-30 14:42:41","2025-10-30 14:43:25","2025-10-30 14:42:41","233–244-33–244","","2","118","","","Sinyolo (2017)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294954","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\RTEQPNSB\Sinyolo Sikhulumile et al. - 2017 - Assessing the Impact of Social Grant-Dependency on Participation of KwaZulu-Natal Rural Households i.pdf","","","⚠️ Invalid DOI; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294954","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper investigated the impact of Condition Cash Transfer of HUP on household food security in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. The objectives were to assess the impact of CCT on protecting the beneficiary’s basic level of food consumption from becoming food insecure and also determine if CCT of HUP facilitate the beneficiary to invest in human and other productive assets. The paper utilized descriptive statistics, food security index, Likert scale and propensity score technique to analyse the research objectives. The findings showed that on average, benefitting and non-benefitting households spent about N31,917.78 ($76.46) and N34,898.67 ($83.60) respectively on food per month. Food insecurity was higher among benefiting households compared to non-benefiting households. The Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATET) estimator value was −0.2610. The negative value suggests that, on average, benefiting households spend 26.10% less on food consumption than non-benefitting households. The results imply that the current cash transfer program may not be effectively addressing food insecurity among beneficiaries. However, the CCT program facilitated the beneficiaries’ ability to invest in human and productive assets, enhanced their financial and social inclusion, opened doors to financial services previously inaccessible to many and fostered a sense of community among them. The paper concludes that while conditional cash transfer programs have the potential to positively impact beneficiaries, the government must reassess and potentially adjust the program to better address the current inflationary pressures and ensure its positive impact on the food security of the beneficiaries.","2025","2025-10-30 14:42:41","2025-10-30 14:43:25","2025-10-30 14:42:41","","","6","20","","","Ibok (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294728","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\VP3UIDH3\Ibok Otu W et al. - 2025 - Impact of Conditional Cash Transfer on Households Food Security in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.pdf","","Food security; Nigeria; Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT)","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294728","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study sheds some light on complementarities between Land Tenure Formalization (LTF) and Productive Social Safety Nets (PSSN) programmes in Tanzania. Using the Tanzania national panel survey data (2020/21 wave), we employed a doubly robust Inverse Probability Weighted Regression Adjustment (IPWRA) to estimate the stand-alone and joint impacts of LTF and PSSN on farm productivity, consumption and food security. We find that joint participation in LTF and PSSN programmes significantly improve farm productivity, households’ consumption and food security. We show that joint impacts of LTF and PSSN are greater than sum of stand-alone impacts suggesting a great complementarity between the programmes. Our cross-tenure analysis suggests a stronger joint impact of statutory LTF with PSSN than that of customary LTF with PSSN, and the true opposite for stand-alone impacts. The study recommends the design of pro-poor productive interventions that incorporate potentially complementary interventions for more optimal outcomes.

However, limited empirical evidence has been presented about the significant impact of the program on the well-being of households who participated in the program and the factors that affect the households' decision to participate in the program. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the impact of participation in UPSNP on well-being using household survey data gathered from three main cities of Ethiopia: Dire Dawa, Harar, and Jigjiga in 2022. This study employed both propensity score matching (PSM) and endogenous switching regression (ESR) models to assess the impact of the UPSNP. The result shows that the probability of a household's participation decision is determined by the age of the household head, number of children, savings, house ownership, employment status of the household head, and shock.

Previous empirical studies, however, have found that this diversification carries no guarantee of success. This study examines the impacts of investments in conservation-based enterprises and micro-credit interventions implemented in coastal Tanzania. Project beneficiaries (n=178) and non-beneficiaries (n=117) from seventeen communities surrounding Saadani National Park and the Menai Bay Conservation area were surveyed in 2013, to gather quantitative and qualitative data on a suite of parameters including the number of livelihood activities, total annual income, and engagement in extractive activities. We found that the beneficiaries reported an average of 2.15 livelihoods, which was significantly higher than the 1.44 average reported by the non-beneficiaries. The beneficiaries also had significantly higher mean annual incomes than the non-beneficiaries as the former reported an annual mean income of US $2,076 while the latter reported US $646. The research found a complex relationship between occupational diversity and people's interactions with the environment and it is clear that livelihood diversification is not a blanket solution to reducing pressure on coastal resources. Another important finding from the research is that there are distinct differences between types of livelihood interventions and it is crucial to be clear about the goal of a livelihoods intervention. If the goal is diversifying livelihoods and strengthening resilience, then livelihoods that provide a small and steady income for many entrepreneurs may be enough. However, if the goal is to bring people out of a poverty trap, then it makes more sense to invest in livelihoods that bring in a higher income, even if that means reaching fewer beneficiaries.","2017","2025-10-30 14:42:55","2025-10-30 14:43:39","2025-10-30 14:42:55","199-218","","3","45","","","Torell (2017)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121314164","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\ZTTFU7GK\Torell E et al. - 2017 - Coastal livelihood diversification as a pathway out of poverty and vulnerability experiences from T.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121314164","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The work assumes that the variable Pronaf does not directly affect poverty and it does so from the variation of income and/or changes in income distribution. The literature review indicated that an increase in per capita income and a decrease in the Gini coefficient lead to a reduction of rural poverty, and a positive change in Pronaf credits leads to an increase in per capita household income and a decrease in the income concentration. The estimates for rural Brazilian indicate that: (i) the increase in per capita income or decrease in income inequality tend to reduce poverty; (ii) the effect of Pronaf on the average per capita income and income inequality is conditioned by the socioeconomic specifics of observation units, and (iii) the expenses of Pronaf tend to indirectly reduce poverty by increasing the average income of farmers and reducing the income concentration.","2014","2025-10-30 14:42:55","2025-10-30 14:43:38","2025-10-30 14:42:55","S147-S166","","Suppl. 1","52","","","Batista (2014)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121316303","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\4ENKAS23\Batista H R et al. - 2014 - Effects of Pronaf on rural poverty in Brazil (2001-2009).pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121316303","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Growth through Nutrition is a five-year (2016-2021), multi-sector nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programme implemented in 110 districts in four regions of Ethiopia that aims to prevent stunting in the first 1,000 days of life. Alongside WASH and livelihoods interventions, social behaviour change communication (SBCC) is targeted to very poor households with family members within the first 1,000 days' window. The SBCC component, Enhanced Community Conversations, involves 10 discussion sessions in peer groups (15-20 members) facilitated by trained volunteers on set topics related to healthy nutrition and WASH practices, with follow-up home visits. Some groups also receive virtual facilitation in the form of audio recordings on the same set topics. Qualitative and quantitative assessments revealed improvements between baseline and midline in provision of a minimum acceptable diet to infants age 6 to 23 months, iron and folic acid supplementation in pregnant women, number of antenatal and postnatal care contacts, and household WASH practices. Results on the impact of breastfeeding behaviours were mixed (qualitative results suggested improvement, but this was not reflected in quantitative results). The addition of virtual audio facilitation showed some statistically significant improved outcomes, but this should be balanced against costs. Results demonstrate the importance of SBCC within a package of nutrition-sensitive interventions, targeting men with SBCC messaging as drivers of change in households, and the potential for institutionalising this approach in routine government systems. The impact on maternal and child nutrition outcomes (including stunting) will be measured at endline.","2020","2025-10-30 14:42:53","2025-10-30 14:43:38","2025-10-30 14:42:53","56-59","","62","","","","Abebe (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121300172","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121300172","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that the multiple targeted poverty alleviation policies have significantly reduced the livelihood vulnerability of poverty-stricken households, and the impact is greater on marginal households. Diversified targeted poverty alleviation policies have reduced the livelihood vulnerability of the poverty-stricken population mainly through increasing income diversification, improving farmers' trust in the government, and enhancing their motivation to get rich. In addition, the impact of different poverty alleviation policies on the livelihood vulnerability of poverty-stricken rural households varies. Industrial poverty alleviation policies and mixed poverty alleviation policies have the most prominent impact, followed by labor employment transfer policies, and then by housing project policies, while the impact of education poverty alleviation policies is not significant.","2021","2025-10-30 20:04:20","2025-10-17 00:20:29","2025-10-30 20:04:20","","","5","","","","Li (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121356488","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121356488","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the impact of these programs on poverty reduction has been little explored. This study examines the impact of CDD on poverty reduction using a cross-sectional research design and randomized multistage sampling to survey 202 households across three wards in Babati District, Tanzania. The analysis employs a Probit model and Endogenous Switching Regression (ESR) to estimate factors influencing household participation decisions and to assess the impact of CDD on household income used as a proxy for poverty reduction while correcting for selection bias. Key factors positively influencing household participation in CDD include the household head’s age (0.1203), household size (0.2265), marital status (0.0867), and poverty status (0.3805). In contrast, access to credit (−0.4787) and social group membership (−0.2322) reduced the likelihood of participation. ESR results show that TASAF beneficiaries achieved a significantly higher mean log income (8.7857) compared to the counterfactual scenario without participation (7.8962), resulting in an Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) of 0.8895. Similarly, non-beneficiaries would have increased their income to 8.5849 from 7.9891 had they participated, yielding an Average Treatment Effect on the Untreated (ATU) of 0.5958. These findings confirm the program’s effectiveness in improving household income and reducing poverty. To enhance effectiveness, the study recommends tailoring support based on household characteristics, linking CDD initiatives with financial services, improving transparency and community trust, and targeting marginalized groups such as female-headed and asset-poor households. Strengthening monitoring systems and local governance will also support sustainable and equitable outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-10-30 20:04:20","2025-10-16 23:14:05","2025-10-30 20:04:20","","","1","3","","","Komba (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121354933","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121354933","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The question is whether traditional strategies employed by farmers are adequate to curb unavoidable natural disasters. This study aims to see how crop insurance affects cocoa producers' incomes in Ghana. A well-structured questionnaire was delivered to a sample of 600 cocoa farmers in Ghana's Ashanti region, and data was collected using a multi-stage random sampling technique. Tobit and propensity score matching effect estimators were used to examine crop insurance's impact on cocoa farmers' income. We found that the age of a cocoa farmer has a negative effect on the farmer's income and is statistically significant. Our result also shows that the marital status of cocoa farmers has a significant positive impact on their income. The relationship between savings and farmers' income was positive in our estimation. It indicates that an increase in savings attitude leads to a higher income for the farmers. The result indicates that crop insurance had a significant positive impact on cocoa farmers' income in the Ashanti region. The study recommends that the government of Ghana, with urgency, design agricultural insurance policy that can capture various farmers in the country to enhance their income and reduce poverty. Again, insurers need to promote publicity through public seminars, training, and media advertising to improve farmer awareness and knowledge of the insurance scheme.","2022","2025-10-30 20:04:20","2025-10-30 20:04:38","2025-10-30 20:04:20","62371-62381","","41","29","","","Agbenyo (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121345400","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121345400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, we studied the impact of intervention intensity on livelihood resilience through the multiple linear regression model. The results revealed that: (1) the livelihood interventions enjoyed by out-of-poverty farmer in mountain areas were multiple. The proportion of farmers enjoyed diversified livelihood interventions was in descending order of high mountain areas, semi-mountain area and Chuanba valley areas.

However, these supports cannot mitigate all of the deprivations the poor endure. The alleviation impact of human support is observed in education and health deprivations, but that of living support is limited to health deprivation. Employment and living standard deprivations appear to not be significantly influenced by both supports.

Here we provide the first evidence that we can conduct such program evaluations based solely on high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning methods. Our application estimates changes in household welfare in a recent anti-poverty program in rural Kenya. Leveraging a large literature documenting a reliable relationship between housing quality and household wealth, we infer changes in household wealth based on satellite-derived changes in housing quality and obtain consistent results with the traditional field-survey based approach. Our approach generates inexpensive and timely insights on program effectiveness in international development programs.","2021","2025-10-30 20:04:13","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-30 20:04:13","","","","","","","Huang (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328523","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328523","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PSSN is based on a set of integrated interventions targeted for the poorest and most vulnerable households: (i) a labour-intensive public works (PW) programme; (ii) conditional cash transfers (CCTs); (iii) a livelihood enhancement (LE) component providing support to households' economic driven interventions (such as community savings and investments); and (iv) targeted infrastructure, supporting development and rehabilitation of social infrastructures under education, health and water sectors. During the period 2013-2019, TASAF vastly scaled up the programme in five waves, enrolling 1.1 million households and 5.1 million individuals in 9960 communities, representing approximately 10.5 percent of the total population. A randomized impact evaluation was embedded within the scaled-up design of the PSSN, which found that even after a short period of implementation (2015-2017), the PSSN achieved several objectives including: increased consumption and food security, investment in better living conditions and human capital accumulation. To complement the findings of the official PSSN impact evaluation, this study analyses the indirect effects of the PSSN on the overall local economy. A local economy-wide impact evaluation (LEWIE) model is used to simulate income and production spillovers from the PSSN. CCTs create both nominal and real income multipliers that significantly exceed one. Each Tanzanian shilling (TZS) transferred to poor households raises nominal or ""cash"" income in local economies by TZS 2.09 (while the real or inflation-adjusted multiplier is 1.55). The CCT and PW increase real income but also increase production activities, with households without labour increasing by more than the others in crop production while ineligible households receive more of the increase in value in other activities. If PW assets increase agricultural productivity in the local economy, multipliers and real income are much higher than in the other scenarios. Assuming PW assets increase agricultural TFP by 5 percent, the real income multiplier increases from 1.56 to 2.96, an increase of 1.4. The percent real income growth in the local economy also increases by 2.67 percentage points (from 2.99 to 5.66).","2023","2025-10-30 20:04:13","2025-10-30 20:04:45","2025-10-30 20:04:13","","","","","","","Daidone (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121316729","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121316729","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The microfinance banks (MFBs) were promoted to provide financial services to the economically active poor in the society and to create an environment of financial inclusion to boost the capacity of micro, small and medium enterprises that abound in our rural areas. The impact of the MFBs in rural development in Nigeria was empirically evaluated in this study using some performance indicators. These include growth in deposit mobilization, aggregate credit extension, loan per rural person (LPRP), total assets of MFBs, etc. The ordinary least square econometrics was used to generate the regression coefficients and other statistics. Data for the study were gathered from the Annual Report and Accounts published by the MFBs and collated and analyzed by the CBN in the Statistical Bulletins. The impetus for the study was largely derived from the renewed interest in microfinancing by the World Bank, International Development Institutions, the Nigerian Government and other International Development Partners. The results of the study show that MFBs have impacted positively on our rural economy. The regression coefficients for all the key factors analyzed in the research were positive though not statistically significant. This means that the full impact possibilities of these institutions as catalyst for rural development are yet to be realized. The findings also provide significant support to the rationale earlier canvassed by the CBN for the recent re-engineering of the various microfinance institutions in the country in order to improve their impact possibilities. The researchers noted that the recent re-engineering and retooling of the MFBs scheme is one step in the right direction and recommends that government should provide key infrastructures especially electricity and ensure stable macroeconomic environment to enable micro and other business enterprises to thrive in the country.","2014","2025-10-30 20:04:13","2025-10-30 20:04:46","2025-10-30 20:04:13","147-171","","2","10","","","Agbaeze (2014)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121316472","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121316472","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Extreme poor households took part in the IGA programme for 2 years and recruitment took place over four waves in annual cycles. Children and mothers were measured with regarding their nutritional status before and after the IGA programme commenced. Settings: Rural Bangladesh. Subjects: Three-hundred and eighty-two children under 5 years of age at recruitment, and their mothers. Results: After 2 years of the IGA programme, the prevalence of stunting significantly declined from 40.3% to 33.0% (P=0.003), anaemia declined from 51.6% to 44.0% (P=0.020) while mothers' CED (Chronic Energy Deficiency) declined from 52.0% to 42.7% (P<0.001), but no significant changes were found in children's wasting, declining from 25.4% to 21.5%, underweight which remained the same at 43.2%, while mothers' anaemia rose from 39.3% to 42.7%. There were also highly significant improvements in household socio-economic status. Increases in socio-economic security (especially in relation to cash savings and net income) and improvements in food quantity and quality (indicated by greater food diversity and animal food intake) were associated with normal nutritional status, and cessation of open defecation was associated with reduction in mothers' and child anaemia. Conclusion: The IGA programme was associated with increased household socio-economic security, such as asset accumulation, food security and sanitation, and with improvements in the nutritional status of children and their mothers in extreme poor households.","2019","2025-10-30 20:04:13","2025-10-30 20:04:47","2025-10-30 20:04:13","3073-3082","","16","22","","","Goto (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121303838","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121303838","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Morocco, where issues of inequality and poverty are high on the national agenda, a community development program, the National Initiative for Human Development, targeted high-poverty areas for additional investments. This paper examines whether, in addition to reducing poverty, such programs can also promote human development, specifically early childhood development. Early childhood development forms a critical foundation for later human development and plays a key role in the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status. Using panel data on communities just above and below the cutoff for National Initiative for Human Development inclusion in rural areas, regression discontinuity and fixed effect models are applied to identify the impact of the program on economic outcomes and early childhood development. Although the analysis finds some transitory impacts of the program on economic outcomes, it finds no impacts on early childhood development. Reducing inequality and promoting human development through early childhood development is likely to require specific, targeted, and sustained initiatives.","2016","2025-10-30 20:04:13","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:04:13","38-8","","","","","","El-Kogali (2016)","","","","World Bank Policy Research Working Paper","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295797      DOI: 10.1596/1813-9450-7671","","","","Impact Evaluation; Community Development; Poverty Reduction; Early Childhood Development","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295797","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Importantly, we find evidence that the interventions contribute to female empowerment by changing the intra-household decision-making process.

We use data from the quasi-experimental mixed method impact evaluation of Ghanas Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) 1000 program, a social cash transfer program for pregnant women and mothers of children under one year living in poverty, to estimate program effects on social support and participation.

In addition, program beneficiaries are more likely to participate in community groups. In in-depth interviews, participants confirmed increased support with descriptions of improved access to financial markets, such as borrowing money or contributing to local savings schemes, and strengthening of social participation in local groups and gatherings.

Difference-in-difference and propensity score matching estimations are used to determine the impact of program participation on the household Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). We found that program participation reduced the MPI significantly, which is mainly driven by the food insecurity dimension, and that the reduction in poverty is due to the reduction in the incidence and intensity, the latter in particular, of poverty among the ultra-poor households. Our analysis of the political economy of Kenya suggests that, while the government is making progress in the institutionalization of social protection, weaknesses in the implementation and financing of the program, as well as the short-term focus of impact evaluation, may undermine the program's potential to help build a strong state that is accountable for the eradication of poverty.","2018","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:58","","","","124","","","Song (2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295412","","","","Developing Countries; Africa; EE950; Africa South of Sahara; Commonwealth of Nations; subsaharan Africa; ACP Countries; Anglophone Africa; East Africa; EE116; Food Economics; Aid; development programs; EE125; poverty alleviation; Income and Poverty","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295412","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Household water treatment with chlorine significantly reduces morbidity due to waterborne diseases. However, the effect of point-of-use (POU) water treatment in improving the quality of water in areas where POU is not provided free of charge and the effectiveness of home visits in inspiring household members to use POU regularly have not been studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of drinking water disinfection by chlorination on diarrheal disease reduction among children under the age of 5 years in rural eastern Ethiopia. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was carried out in rural Dire Dawa from October 2018 through January 2019. The 405 households were randomized to intervention and control arms and intervention materials were distributed after conducting a baseline survey. This trial evaluated the effectiveness of household drinking water disinfection by chlorination in reducing incidence of diarrhea among children under the age of 5 years. Intervention households received 1.2% sodium hypochlorite with demonstration of its proper use. Participants in the control households continued with their usual habits of water collection and water storage. Generalized estimation equation (GEE) with log link Poisson distribution family and exchangeable correlation matrix was used to compute crude incidence rate ratio (IRR), adjusted IRR and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Results: In the intervention households, in total, 281 cases of diarrhea were documented (8.7 cases per 100 person-weeks observation); in the control households, in total 446 cases of diarrhea were documented (13.8 cases per 100 person-weeks observation). A 36.0% (adjusted IRR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.570.73) reduction in incidence of diarrhea was observed in the intervention arm when compared with the control arm. The highest and the lowest reductions were obtained in children of age ranges 1 to 2 years and 3 to 4 years, 42.7 and 30.4%, respectively. Adherence to the intervention was 81.3% as measured by free residual chlorine test. Conclusions: In rural areas where diarrhea is the second leading cause of morbidity, water chlorination at the household level using liquid bleach considerably reduced episodes of diarrhea among children under the age of 5 years. Therefore, chlorinating drinking water at the household level may be a valuable interim solution for reducing the incidence of diarrheal diseases until potable water is made accessible to the majority of the population in Dire Dawa Administration and other Ethiopian communities.

In 2015, one of the strongest El Niño cycles on record exposed parts of Ethiopia to the worst drought in decades. At its height, over 10 million people were in need of food aid with a value over one billion dollars. Even as the response mounted, this humanitarian crisis enabled Mercy Corps to test the impact of its resilience programming under the USAID-funded Pastoralist Areas Resilience Improvement through Market Expansion (PRIME) project. This unique impact evaluation is among the first to rigorously evaluate the effects of a resilience-focused project in the face of a severe shock. The results are encouraging, with compelling evidence that supports the efficacy of multi-year, flexibly funded, integrated approaches to building resilience to severe shocks. Specifically, households that had benefitted from PRIME fared better than others in the face of drought through their: Enhanced food security: Households reached by PRIME were better able to maintain sufficient food consumption, a key indication that the program improved people’s income and/or access to markets to enable them to consume more nutritious foods even during crisis. Greater assets and lower vulnerability to poverty: PRIME interventions had a positive impact on households’ ability to maintain important household and livestock assets and avoid impoverishment in the face of the drought. Better animal health and fewer livestock deaths: Compared to the non-targeted households, PRIME beneficiaries were able to maintain healthier herds despite the severe drought conditions. They were less likely to experience animal deaths, and in particular were able to protect their breeding females. No impacts on coping strategies: Both PRIME and comparison group households used similar types and amounts of response mechanisms to manage the effects of the drought. No impacts on ‘downstream’ shocks: There were no differences between PRIME beneficiaries and the comparison group concerning shocks experienced, including any knock-on effects of the drought like market price shocks or animal disease.","2017","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:58","","","","","","","Sagara (2017)","","","","Other","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295339      DOI: No DOI","","","","Resilience; Shocks; Drought risk management; Livestock management","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295339","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Those with high aspirations set ambitious goals for themselves, and those with low aspirations may fall prey to a poverty trap. Do natural disasters negatively impact aspirations? If so, can governments blunt these effects? We consider Pakistan's devastating 2010 floods--and the government's uneven relief efforts--to analyze these questions. We first show that the extreme rainfall generating this disaster significantly reduced aspirations, even when current levels of household expenditure, wealth, and education are taken into account. Individuals experiencing 2010 monsoon season rainfall that was one standard deviation higher than average had aspiration levels 1.5 years later that were 0.15 standard deviations lower than those of similar individuals experiencing just average levels of rainfall. This is the same negative shock to aspirations that one would experience as a result of a 50% reduction in household expenditures. Moreover, the negative effect of natural disasters on aspirations is especially strong among the poor, and among those who are most vulnerable to weather shocks. However, exploiting exogenous variation in flood relief access, we show that government social protection can attenuate these negative impacts. Individuals in villages that received Citizens Damage Compensation (Watan Card) Program flood relief--providing cash equivalent to 9.4% of annual household expenditures in each of the three years following the disaster--saw significantly lower declines in aspirations than did those in similarly affected villages without this relief. This offers a new understanding of social protection; it not only restores livelihoods and replaces damaged assets, but also has an enduring effect by easing mental burdens, and thus raising aspirations for the future. The negative effects of natural disasters and the efficacy of government relief programs may thus be underestimated if aspirations are ignored.","2017","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:58","49-66","","","97","","","Kosec (2017)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295333","","","","South Asia; Climate change; Pakistan; Political psychology; State Capacity; Political economy of development","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295333","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most studies fail to distinguish between these two; thus, we know little about which effects dominate and their long-term welfare implications. This study uses a random distribution of discount coupons and drought events that trigger payouts as exogenous variations in order to identify both the ex ante risk-management and ex post payout effects of index-based livestock insurance in a pastoral-dominant society of northern Kenya, where the literature has detected asset-based poverty traps, represented by bifurcated herd-size dynamics. We find that, first, both risk-management and payout effects help reduce the probability of distress sales of livestock. Second, payout effects also reduce the slaughter of livestock. Finally, while payout effects remain robust for the sub-sample of poorer households below the poverty-trap threshold, statistically significant risk-management effects on reduced livestock sales disappear for them. Overall, our results suggest that insurance payouts can help the poor escape poverty traps, while the impact of behavioural changes accompanied by insurance purchases is more subtle in our settings.","2020","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2079-2096","","11","56","","","Noritomo (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295332","","","","KENYA; Disaster risk reduction; Instrumental Variable; Insurence pay outs","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"TEUGVTSI","journalArticle","2011","Hidrobo Melissa Lucia","Essays on income shocks and health in Ecuador","UC Berkeley","","","No DOI","https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8t70d0wn","This dissertation examines how exogenous changes in income a ect the most vulnerable populations in Ecuador: poor children and their mothers. It explores the e ects of a negative income shock that is due to the 1998-2000 economic crisis and a positive income shock that is due to the introduction of a cash transfer program, the Bono de Desarrollo Humano. The outcomes examined are those related to early childhood development and to spousal domestic violence. Both improvements in child development and reductions in domestic violence are crucial for breaking the inter-generational transmission of poverty and for achieving the Millennium Development goals. The  rst chapter of this dissertation investigates the e ects of Ecuador's 1998-2000 economic crisis on child health and cognitive development. This crisis was characterized by a drastic increase in prices and the eventual adoption of the dollar as its currency. While many reports show that household consumption decreased and poverty increased, there are no studies on the impact of the crisis on child development. I use data from three and  ve years after the crisis to investigate whether the Ecuadorian crisis had a negative and persistent impact on children's height and language development. In order to estimate the e ect of the crisis on child outcomes I take advantage of the variation in children's exposure to the crisis that is due to birth month and province. Results suggest that one year of exposure to the crisis signi cantly decreased height-for-age z-scores by .1 SD and vocabulary test scores by 2.4 points. The e ect of the crisis, however, was not uniform across households. Particularly, in rural areas children from farming households and those with more access to early childhood nutrition programs were signi cantly more protected from the crisis. Potential pathways through which the crisis impacted child outcomes are also explored. The second chapter, which is co-authored with Lia Fernald, takes advantage of the randomized roll-out of Ecuador's Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH) to examine the e ects of an exogenous increase in income on the health and development outcomes of very young children. Families enrolled in the BDH received a monthly cash stipend ($15 USD) representing an approximate 6-10% 1 increase in household income. Participants analyzed in this study are children 12-35 months old from treatment and comparison communities in rural and urban Ecuador. Main outcomes measured are language skills (the Fundación MacArthur Inventorio del Desarollo de Habilidades Comunicativas - Breve), height-for-age z-score, and hemoglobin concentration. Results indicate that in rural areas, being randomized to receive the BDH in very early childhood led to signi cantly better performance on the number of words a child was saying, and on the probability that the child was combining two or more words. There were no signi cant e ects on language development for children in urban areas and there were no e ects on height-for-age z-score or hemoglobin concentration in rural or urban areas. A limited number of potential pathways with respect to cognitive/language stimulation, health behaviors, and parenting quality are also explored. Findings indicate that compared to children in comparison areas, rural children in treatment areas were more likely to have received vitamin A or iron supplementation and have been bought a toy in the past six months. The third chapter, which is co-authored with Lia Fernald, also takes advantage of the randomized roll-out of the Bono de Desarrollo Humano to investigate how an exogenous increase in a mother's income impacts spousal domestic violence. We use existing household bargaining models to predict when a cash transfer will lead to an increase in domestic violence and when it will lead to a decrease. Consistent with predictions, results reveal that for more educated women who had more credible outside-of-marriage options, the BDH decreased psychological violence. However, for less educated women who did not have credible outside options, the e ect of the cash transfer was ambiguous and depended on whether the husband or partner had more education than his wife or partner. In particular, for less educated women the cash transfer decreased psychological violence in households where the husband or partner had more education than his wife or partner, and it increased psychological violence in households where the opposite was true. Although the BDH led to signi cant changes in psychological violence, it did not lead to corresponding changes in physical violence","2011","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2025-10-30 20:06:51","2025-10-30 20:05:58","","","","","","","Hidrobo (2011)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295261","","","","","⚠️ Invalid DOI; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295261","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper takes the case of Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) andprovides evidence of the impact of safety nets on household food security and child nutritional outcomes. Priorstudies provide inconclusive evidence as to whether PSNP has improved household food security and childnutrition. These studies used analytical approaches that correct for selection bias but have overlooked the effectof time-varying confounders that might have resulted in biased estimation. Given that household food securitystatus is both the criteria for participation and one of the desirable outcomes of the program, estimating thecausal impact of PSNP on household food security and child nutrition is prone to endogeneity due to selectionbias and time-varying confounders. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are (1) to examine the impacts of PSNPon household food security, child meal frequency, child diet diversity, and child anthropometry using marginalstructural modeling approach that takes into account both selection bias and time-varying confounders and (2) toshed some light on policy and programmatic implications. Results show that PSNP has not improved householdfood insecurity, child dietary diversity, and child anthropometry despite its positive impact on child meal fre­quency. Household participation in PSNP brought a 0.308 unit gain on child meal frequency.

Since the program provides assets to the main female of the household, this transfer is expected to alter their childrens study time, market and non-market activities. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we find that the likelihood of a child adopting self-employment increases significantly across all waves as a result of asset transfer. However, there is significant temporal and gender differences in the effects on their study time: the effect is negative in the short run but positive in the long run for the boys, but not significantly so for the girls. Our findings corroborate the Beckerian model of time allocation: in the short run asset transfer expands the earning opportunities inducing substitution of study time for work, especially among the boys. Eventually as income rises over time, demand for education rises study time. Our results also show that the asset transfer program is likely to reduce gender gap in skilled employment as girls become less likely to undertake unskilled work both relative to the boys in her household and all children in the non-participating households. The children of program participant households who were involved in unskilled work at the start of the program are likely to spend significantly more time on agricultural self-employment and less time on unskilled work uniformly across time.","2021","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:58","","","","","","","Ara (2021)","","","","QUT Business School","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295402      DOI: No DOI","","","","Bangladesh; Gender; Child labor; Asset transfer; Working hours","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295402","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study also considered how the programme could be sustained to promote early development in children aged under 3 years in the poorest areas of rural China. Study design A quasi-experimental design was applied, with data collection before and after a 2-year programme implementation, in both intervention and comparison (control) areas. Methods From July 2014, the Integrated Early Childhood Development (IECD) programme was implemented in poverty-stricken areas in four counties of China. Nurturing care intervention focusing on five components (child health, nutrition, responsive care, protection and early learning support) was delivered mainly by the village early childhood development centre and township/village clinic. Another two counties of similar per capita gross domestic product, geographical characteristics, under-five mortality rate, under-five underweight prevalence and ethnicity to the four programme counties were selected as the comparison and received no IECD programme intervention. The Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaire was used to evaluate the neurodevelopmental outcome of children; the overall suspected developmental delay (SDD) referred to any developmental delay in the communication, gross-motor, fine-motor or problem-solving or personal-social domains of the questionnaire. Children underwent anthropometric measurements and haemoglobin concentration testing through peripheral blood. Face-to-face interviews of caregivers were conducted to collect intervention use, cognitive stimulation and child-protection behaviours. A difference-in-differences regression approach, adjusting for confounding factors, was applied to estimate intervention impact on the neurodevelopmental outcomes in the children. Path analysis was employed to examine the mediating effects of growth, nutrition status, cognitive stimulation and child-protection behaviours through which the IECD intervention predicted children's developmental health. Results In total, 2953 children aged under 3 years and their caregivers were enrolled at baseline, and 2745 child-caregiver pairs completed the postintervention assessment. Prevalence of overall SDD was reduced by 18% (from 37% at baseline to 19% at postintervention) in intervention counties, which is a significant difference compared with the 10% reduction in control counties (from 30% to 20%), with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.540.89). Consistent findings were found across domains. Path analysis indicated that the effect of the intervention on promoting developmental health was mediated by multiple nurturing care-associated factors, including cognitive stimulation frequency, positive discipline, length-for-age growth and haemoglobin concentration. Conclusions The community-based integrated intervention could significantly prevent developmental delay in children aged under 3 years in rural China. Highlights A community-based, integrated and nurturing care-supporting intervention was established in rural areas. Intervention reduced the prevalence of developmental delay in disadvantaged children. Family processes mediated the link between intervention and early development.

Using a counterfactual approach, this study assessed the impact of the Commercial Agricultural Development Project (CADP) in Nigeria on poverty status of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries; determine its impact on commercialization of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries and ascertain the pro-poor impact of the Project. Data from 1199 households comprising 678 beneficiaries and 521 non-beneficiaries were used for analysis. Propensity score matching was used to select comparable observations which reduced the sample size to 1142 observations: 655 beneficiaries, 487 non-beneficiaries. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, propensity score matching technique, Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) poverty measures, Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT) and Poverty equivalent growth rate (PEGR) pro-poor measure. FGT poverty indices were lower for CADP Beneficiaries than the non-beneficiaries. The impact of the CADP on poverty using the income of beneficiaries as proxy showed that those who participated in CADP had their income increased by N446,073.89 ($ 1,239.09) and were better off in terms of their welfare compared to those who did not participate in the program. For the impact on commercialization, the programme led to a statistically significant increase in the commercialization index of beneficiaries. Also the PEGR for non-beneficiaries was higher than the actual growth rate while that of beneficiaries was less than the actual growth rate implying that CADP was not pro-poor. The study concludes that even though the CADP impacted the poverty level of beneficiaries positively, it was not pro-poor hence there is a need to ensure that the poor are effectively targeted in designing development intervention programmes.

The study applied random effects with instrumental variables to estimate the effect of PSNP membership. The results of the study indicate that, although PSNP membership improves household food consumption, it reduces the household dietary diversity score. Household food consumption and dietary diversity are also significantly influenced by sex, age, education status of household head, household size, livestock ownership, distance to the nearest market and participation in non-farm activities. The findings of this study suggest that PSNP membership should be reinforced by building household awareness of the benefits of consuming a variety of foods. In addition, PSNP membership should be designed to endow the households to accumulate essential assets, especially livestock.","2021","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:58","283-296","","4","16","","","Feyisa (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295377","","","","PSNP; Instrumental Variables; Household dietary diversity; Household Food Consumption; Random effects","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295377","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though most of these programmes are not explicitly designed to help households manage climate risk, there are good reasons to expect that cash transfers can be good instrument to build household resilience against climatic risk. The goal of this study is to provide an empirical analysis of the effect of weather risk on rural households’ welfare using impact evaluation data from the Zambia Child Grant Programme (CGP) together with set of novel weather variation indicators based on interpolated gridded and re-analysis weather data that capture the peculiar features of short term and long term variations in rainfall. In particular, we estimate the impact of weather shocks on a rich set of welfare and food security indicators (including total expenditure, food expenditure, non-food expenditure, calorie intake and dietary diversity) and investigate the role of cash transfer for managing climate risk. We find strong evidence that cash transfer programmes has a mitigating role against the negative effects of weather shocks. Our results in fact highlight how important the receipt of social cash transfer is for households lying in the bottom quantile of consumption and food security distributions in moderating the negative effect of weather shock. Hence, integrating climate change and social protection tools into a comprehensive poverty reduction and social protection strategy should be of primary interest for policy makers and government when setting their policy agenda.","2016","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:58","","","","","","","Asfaw (2016)","","","","Other","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295368      DOI: NO Doi","","","","Africa; Impact; Zambia; Experimental Design; Cash transfer; Weather Shock","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295368","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it also serves as a source of raw material for the manufacturing of high-quality cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Due to its high demand, cocoa is regarded as a major commodity for poverty alleviation in deprived cocoa farming communities. Government has therefore instigated relevant measures to address issues facing the sector by investing in extension programs. These programs act as information dissemination tools for teaching modern farming technologies and enhancing learning among farmers. This study highlighted the effects of the Cocoa Life Project (CLP) by Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) International on farm productivity and income of 200 cocoa farmers in three districts of the Eastern Region, Ghana. Regression on covariates, Heckman’s treatment effects model, and propensity scores were used to test the robustness of the estimates. A positive association between extension program participation, farm productivity, and household income was discovered. Specifically, after correcting for selection bias, the estimated results of the Heckman’s model showed that the extension program significantly increased participating farmers’ cocoa yield by 14.3%. The effects on total farm income showed a significant increase of 25.1 and 42.9%, respectively from regression on propensity scores and the Heckman’s model. Across all three models, program participation led to an increase in total household income by 46.1, 31.7, and 69.3%, respectively. Other variables such as farming characteristics, institutional and demographic factors affected farmers’ income, depending on the estimation method used. This study reiterated the supporting role played by extension programs in enhancing cocoa production and increasing household income in Ghana. Conclusively, government and development partners should invest in extension programs by providing enough logistics, training qualified agents, and creating a conducive atmosphere to support learning and technology adoption.","2021","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2820–2836-820–2836","","10","20","","","Attipoe (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295349","","","","Extension; Smallholders; Cocoa; Heckman’s model; Regression on propensity scores","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295349","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CT scheme had large positive effects on several nutritional inputs including food expenditure and meal frequency. However, there was no effect on height-for-age. Production function estimates indicate that food carries little weight in the production of child height. Health knowledge of mothers and health infrastructure in the study sites are also very poor. These factors plus the harsh disease environment are too onerous to be overcome by the increases in food intake generated by the CT.

Small-scale irrigation is becoming the main mechanism in livelihood enhancement discourse especially in recent times when the rainfall pattern is becoming erratic in the country. Small-scale irrigation is a policy priority in Ethiopia for rural poverty alleviation and growth, as well as climate adaptation. The aim of the study is to examine the effect of small-scale irrigation on income of rural household in the North Eastern Ethiopia. The study used Taro proportional sampling techniques formula to get 200 sampling respondents of irrigation and non-irrigation users. Econometric model such as Propensity Score Matching method and binary logistic regression model were used to study the specific objectives, impact of use of small-scale irrigation on households' income and determinants of smallholder farmers' decision to participate in small-scale irrigation water use, respectively. The Propensity Score Matching model using logit estimate indicated that family size, credit access and subsidy with productive safety net program were found positive significant effect. The logit model discovered that sex, livestock holding size, dwelling distance from irrigation farm, and subsidy by productive safety net programme and credit access have determinant effect on decision participation in small-scale irrigation. Therefore, attention should be given by the government in expanding of modern irrigation practice and constructing improved storage house should be given priorities.Author(s)","2022","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:58","","","15","8","","","Melese (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295314","","","","Propensity Score Matching (PSM); Income Shocks; Binary logit model; Small-scale irrigation","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295314","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is implemented by the LEAP Management Secretariat (LMS) and the Department of Social Welfare (DSW), under the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MoGCSP). The LEAP Programme, designed to fight poverty among extremely vulnerable populations, provides bimonthly cash payments to extremely poor households with orphans and vulnerable children, elderly with no productive capacity, persons with acute disability, and, in 2015, a pilot called ‘LEAP 1000’ was launched to include a new category – pregnant women and children under the age of 12 months. The LEAP 1000 pilot was launched in 10 districts in the Northern and Upper East regions, reaching 6,124 households. Since then, this additional category has been mainstreamed into the larger LEAP Programme. As of December 2017, LEAP reaches more than 213,000 poor families in all 216 districts of Ghana (8 per cent of which have beneficiaries from the pregnant women or infant category). In order to assess the impacts of the programme on a range of child and household indicators, UNICEF Ghana, working closely with LMS and the MoGCSP, commissioned an independent 2-year impact evaluation study. This report presents impact results from the 2- year ‘endline’ evaluation of the LEAP 1000 Pilot. The UNICEF Office of Research (OoR), the Institute for Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) at the University of Ghana, the University of North Carolina (UNC), and Navrongo Health Research Centre (NHRC) designed a rigorous mixed-methods impact evaluation to estimate the impacts of LEAP 1000. The quantitative methodology uses a regression discontinuity design (RDD) and compares households which are just below a proxy means test (PMT) cut-off score (thus, those who are eligible for LEAP) to those just above the cut-off score (and thus not eligible for LEAP). Households just above and just below the cut-off are very similar as they have nearly identical proxy means test scores, and thus the group of households above the cut-off can serve as a valid comparison group for households below the cut-off who receive the cash transfers. As the sample only includes households close to the cut off, the results of this evaluation are not representative of poorer households that had significantly lower PMT scores. The findings of this evaluation are therefore likely to under-estimate the impacts that may be experienced by the average LEAP household. The panel sample of households for the quantitative analysis (that is, those interviewed at both baseline (2015) and endline (2017)) consists of 1,185 households below the PMT cut-off (treatment) and 1,146 above the PMT cut-off (comparison), for a total of 2,331 households. A sub-sample of 20 women from beneficiary households participated in in-depth interviews three times (baseline (2015), midline (2016), endline (2017); their male partners were interviewed twice (n=13 at midline and n=15 at endline).","2018","2025-10-30 20:05:58","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:58","","","","","","","Handa (2018)","","","","Other","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295294      DOI: noDOI","","","","Children; empowerment; pregnant women; Regression discontinuity design (RDD); Pilot","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295294","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this, the last ten years has seen a shift away from ad hoc responses, such as those that characterized the major drought in 2002, to a planned, systematic approach. This was embodied in the Government of Ethiopia’s Food Security Programme launched in 2005. The Government of Ethiopia has noted that this program had a number of significant achievements, inter alia: More than seven million people have received PSNP transfers enabling them to meet consumption needs, reducing the risks they faced and providing them with alternative options to selling productive assets. In addition, between 692,002 households (around 3.5 million people) received credit financed by the Government’s Federal Food Security Budget Line between 2005 and 2007 . . . . There is also significant evidence that the programme is having an impact. The PSNP is smoothing consumption and protecting assets and a growing number of PSNP clients are having growing access to household building efforts.

"EBJM7MI7","report","2016","Almanzar Miguel; Torero Maximo","Impact Evaluation of Feed the Future/USAID-ACCESO: Agriculture and Nutrition Activities in Western Honduras from 2012-2015","","","","","https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TCJK.pdf",". OVERVIEW OF COMPACT AND INTERVENTION(S) EVALUATED USAID-ACCESO was a four-year activity funded by the USAID Office of Economic Growth in Honduras. Implemented by FINTRAC from 2011-2015, the&nbsp;project&nbsp;aimed to increase household&nbsp;income&nbsp;in order to directly lift 10,000 beneficiary households out of poverty (7,500 out of extreme poverty), as well as to decrease under-nutrition&nbsp;in these households. Until 2015, the activity represented the core investment by USAID-Honduras in the U.S. Government’s (USG) Global Hunger and&nbsp;Food&nbsp;Security Initiative known as the Feed the Future Initiative (FTF) and worked through various components to enable economic development at the household level. These components included: 1. Providing agricultural and value-added technical assistance and training to enhance the capacity of Honduras’s poorest households in production,&nbsp;management, and&nbsp;marketing skills; 2. Facilitating&nbsp;market&nbsp;access by linking&nbsp;farmers to&nbsp;market&nbsp;opportunities; 3. Increasing the availability of rural financial services through existing intermediaries, village banks, commercial banks, and other service and input providers; 4. Assisting in the elimination of&nbsp;policy&nbsp;barriers that impede rural households’ access to&nbsp;market&nbsp;opportunities; 5. Engaging in dietary diversification and malnutrition&nbsp;prevention activities to enhance the capacity of rural households to improve their utilization and consumption of&nbsp;food; and 6. Establishing sound environmental and natural resource&nbsp;management. USAID-ACCESO targeted six of Honduras’s poorest departments in the Occidental region: Copán, Santa Bárbara, Ocotepeque, Lempira, Intibucá, and La Paz. The majority of farm households in these departments cultivate traditional crops on small&nbsp;plots, often on hillsides where access to&nbsp;markets is hindered by poor roads and long distances. In addition, the use of traditional cultural practices produces poor yields, depletes soil nutrients, and leads to forest encroachment. B. EVALUATION TYPE, QUESTIONS, METHODOLOGY This document lays out&nbsp;impact&nbsp;results using the 2012 baseline survey, the 2013 follow-up (midline) survey, and the second follow-up (endline) survey administered in 2015 for the&nbsp;impact&nbsp;evaluation&nbsp;of USAID-ACCESO. From May to July of 2012, 3,326 households in the Occidental part of Honduras were interviewed to collect data on&nbsp;income&nbsp;and&nbsp;expenditures, access to&nbsp;credit, time use, use of land, agricultural practices,&nbsp;nutritional&nbsp;status of women of reproductive age and children under five years of age, and women’s empowerment. The midline survey was conducted between May and July 2013 and administered the same questionnaire to all of the originally interviewed households that could be located. A third and final survey was implemented from May to July 2015, again to all of the originally interviewed households that could be located. Our baseline sample included 1,256 households that were randomly selected from the beneficiary list available at baseline or that reported participating in the&nbsp;program; the remainder of the sample (2,070 households) were comparison households selected randomly from the 2001 Honduran Population Census. The comparison group was selected such that the sample was representative of living conditions in each of the six departments in which USAID-ACCESO operated. The effect of USAID-ACCESO was evaluated with a rigorous, non-experimental&nbsp;design&nbsp;that incorporated&nbsp;matching, a panel survey, and&nbsp;econometric&nbsp;analysis. The&nbsp;impact&nbsp;of the&nbsp;program&nbsp;on various&nbsp;outcomes&nbsp;is estimated using a matched household-level&nbsp;difference-in-differences&nbsp;(DID) estimator with household fixed effects. The&nbsp;impact&nbsp;evaluation&nbsp;measures the&nbsp;changes in&nbsp;outcomes&nbsp;which can be attributed to a specific&nbsp;intervention. For example, the&nbsp;change in household&nbsp;expenditures&nbsp;in the comparison group (expenditures&nbsp;after the&nbsp;program&nbsp;minus&nbsp;expenditures&nbsp;before the&nbsp;program) is subtracted from the&nbsp;change in&nbsp;expenditures&nbsp;of the treatment households in order to estimate the&nbsp;impact&nbsp;of the&nbsp;program&nbsp;on household&nbsp;expenditures. Comparison households are used to account for&nbsp;changes in economic conditions in the area that could affect the&nbsp;income&nbsp;of treated households, even in the absence of treatment. The sample size for the panel survey was chosen to provide 80% power to detect a 10% increase in household&nbsp;expenditures, at a 5% significance level. Our main goal is to assess the&nbsp;impact&nbsp;of&nbsp;participation&nbsp;in ACCESO’s&nbsp;programs and&nbsp;extension&nbsp;services on a variety of&nbsp;outcomes, such as the households’ agricultural production, health, and&nbsp;income. Simply comparing households that have participated in the&nbsp;program&nbsp;to households that have not may cause us to attribute differences to ACCESO that were either preexisting or were caused by something other than the&nbsp;program, and thus to either over- or underestimate the&nbsp;program’s&nbsp;impact. Comparing households that participated in ACCESO before and after the&nbsp;program&nbsp;runs a similar risk; we do not know what the&nbsp;changes we observe would have happened in the absence of the&nbsp;program, and thus we may attribute&nbsp;changes to ACCESO that would have happened regardless. Comparing&nbsp;changes over time among households that were exposed to ACCESO’s&nbsp;extension&nbsp;services to&nbsp;changes over time for households that did not participate in the&nbsp;program&nbsp;allows us to account for initial differences between treated and comparison households, as well as&nbsp;changes over time that affect both groups. In order to ensure that there are no&nbsp;systematic&nbsp;differences between treatment and&nbsp;control&nbsp;households that would suggest they have different&nbsp;trends&nbsp;for our indicators of interest, we compare similar households between both groups. In order to match households appropriately, we construct a&nbsp;propensity&nbsp;score&nbsp;based on pretreatment values of observable&nbsp;characteristics&nbsp;and use the inverse of the&nbsp;score&nbsp;to weight observations in our&nbsp;regression&nbsp;analysis. It is important to note that a household is classified as “treated” if it was on the initial list of beneficiaries at baseline or if it ever reported being part of USAID-ACCESO, regardless of whether the household actively participated in the&nbsp;program. The&nbsp;impact&nbsp;estimates in the report thus measures “intention to treat.” C. FINDINGS We estimate the&nbsp;impact&nbsp;of USAID-ACCESO across&nbsp;all the main&nbsp;outcomes&nbsp;monitored by Feed the Future and added other&nbsp;outcomes&nbsp;of interest to provide a narrative for the&nbsp;impact&nbsp;pathway when&nbsp;impacts&nbsp;are observed or to provide context when the expected&nbsp;impacts&nbsp;are not found. We find some significant effects across&nbsp;the main outcome measures; however, most are not robust across&nbsp;specifications. To summarize the main findings: Agricultural Production: We find an increase in the coffee and corn area planted by endline, as well as some&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;that suggests an increase in crop diversification to vegetable and tuber production. We find&nbsp;changes in the use of inputs among treated&nbsp;farmers; households cultivating coffee, fruit, and tubers increased their use of chemical&nbsp;fertilizer, while households cultivating beans decreased their use of organic&nbsp;fertilizers. We see that vegetable&nbsp;farmers decreased their use of fungicides and herbicides, while fruit&nbsp;farmers increased their use of the same. We see that labor costs increased significantly for coffee and fruit&nbsp;farmers in the treatment group; for coffee, this is consistent with treatment&nbsp;farmers being able to spend more on labor to prevent coffee rust, while for fruit, this might be because treated&nbsp;farmers are able to cultivate long-term, high-value crops with the support given by ACCESO. Overall, we find that agricultural production increased by 2000 kg overall, driven by a 4000 kg increase at endline. In general, the agricultural&nbsp;impact&nbsp;estimates suggest that negative&nbsp;impacts&nbsp;on the quantity of agricultural production and land productivity in the midline were mitigated by increases at endline. We find decreases in the value of production for most of our crops, but the results for corn, beans, coffee, and tubers are driven by wide variations in the reported price. When we test alternative specifications, such as using an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (to account for over dispersion) or using department median prices instead of reported prices (to correct for households misreporting prices), we do not see any effect. Labor&nbsp;Markets: We find an 11 percentage point increase in&nbsp;participation&nbsp;in wage labor and a 9 percentage point increase in&nbsp;participation&nbsp;in the agricultural sector. This increase in&nbsp;participation&nbsp;in wage labor is coupled with a $300 increase in household&nbsp;income&nbsp;from wage labor in treatment households.&nbsp;Expenditures&nbsp;and Poverty: We find no&nbsp;impact&nbsp;on household&nbsp;expenditures&nbsp;or on the proportion of individuals falling below a variety of poverty lines. We detect no differential&nbsp;change in aggregate household&nbsp;expenditures&nbsp;among treated households, nor do we see any&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;of&nbsp;changing&nbsp;expenditures&nbsp;among subcategories of household&nbsp;expenditures&nbsp;(food, non-food, utilities, housing). Hunger, Child Health &amp;&nbsp;Nutrition, Maternal Health &amp;&nbsp;Nutrition: We see an imprecisely measured 1.8 percentage point decrease in the proportion of households that experience moderate to severe hunger at endline, and we see that treated women have a slightly more diverse diet (scoring 0.17 higher on the 9&nbsp;food&nbsp;dietary diversity scale). Aside from an imprecisely measured 1 cm&nbsp;change in the height of treated women, we find no&nbsp;impacts&nbsp;on women’s health or&nbsp;nutrition; specifically, there is no&nbsp;change in women’s BMI or&nbsp;prevalence&nbsp;of anemia. In addition, we find no&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;that children’s&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;improved; we detect no effects on breastfeeding, minimum meal frequency, or dietary diversity. We also see no corresponding&nbsp;changes in child anthropometrics, as the&nbsp;prevalence&nbsp;of stunting, wasting, and anemia in children remains the same. When we disaggregate children’s&nbsp;outcomes&nbsp;by sex, we find a decrease in the proportion of underweight boys, but no&nbsp;impact&nbsp;on girls. Women’s Empowerment We find increasing&nbsp;trends&nbsp;in women’s empowerment during the&nbsp;study&nbsp;period and similar dynamics between treatment and comparison households. The most salient result is that differences in empowerment between men and women in the ZOI are driven mostly from differences in access to resources, assets, and&nbsp;credit. D. CONCLUSIONS We detect no effects on some measures that a priori should be affected by USAID-ACCESO, including agricultural productivity, agricultural sales,&nbsp;nutritional&nbsp;status, household&nbsp;expenditures, and poverty. We expected that by the endline survey, households would have&nbsp;changed their agricultural and&nbsp;nutritional&nbsp;practices as they participated in USAID-ACCESO for longer periods of time and that these&nbsp;changes in practice would translate into improvements in final&nbsp;outcomes. However, we observe no&nbsp;changes in intermediate&nbsp;outcomes&nbsp;or in the main final&nbsp;outcomes. That the&nbsp;project&nbsp;had no significant effects on&nbsp;nutritional&nbsp;indicators is not surprising. USAID-ACCESO was&nbsp;designed to prevent malnutrition&nbsp;rather than to reverse damage caused by past under-nutrition. To detect&nbsp;impacts&nbsp;on intermediate indicators, such as dietary diversity and minimum meal frequency, the&nbsp;intervention&nbsp;should have specifically targeted undernourished children and provided households with extra resources to improve child&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;rather than just relying on household production to meet&nbsp;nutritional&nbsp;needs. We also note that the&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;component of USAID-ACCESO had limited coverage in the zone of influence; only 225 communities received the&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;component, in comparison with over 2,700 communities that participated in the agricultural component. In the case of agricultural productivity and&nbsp;market&nbsp;access indicators, we expect that longer exposure to treatment, through new&nbsp;interventions increasing access to irrigation, and reinforcement of good agricultural practices will improve these indicators. One possible explanation for why we did not observe significant&nbsp;impacts&nbsp;on these indicators may be the result of large aggregate shocks. Although aggregate shocks are not likely to differentially affect the treatment and comparison groups, such a shock (like that experienced with recent outbreaks of coffee rust) could decrease the resources available to all households and, as a consequence, the take-up of new practices and the introduction of more nutritious&nbsp;foods.","2016","2025-10-30 20:05:55","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:55","","","","","","","Almanzar (2016)","","","","International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295199      DOI: No DOI","","","","Honduras; Feed the Future; Matched difference in differences; USAID-ACCESO","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295199","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"58C5TPTZ","report","2013","Sikwela Misery Mpuzu","The impact of farmer support programmes on market access of smallholder farmers in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, South Africa","","","","","https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/145044473.pdf","Most smallholder farmers in South Africa are characterized by poor resources such as land, labour and capital while they play an important role in poverty alleviation especially in poor rural areas. Smallholder farmers are increasingly recognized because of their contribution to household food security. The world markets are increasingly being integrated due to globalization and liberalization. As a result, smallholder farmers are facing increasing market competition, not only in international markets but in local markets as well. However, smallholder farmers often face a number of barriers to accessing these markets arising in part from the tightening of food safety and quality standards requiring compliance with phytosanitary and sanitary standards and growing power of supply chain integration. Furthermore, the viability of these smallholder producers is constrained by institutional obstacles which include lack of access to information, high marketing and transaction costs and low quality and lack of critical volume in the absence of bulking up arrangements, etc. These barriers have contributed to the exclusion of smallholder/small-scale farmers from formal markets. In order to address these obstacles and speed up the pace of agrarian reform many support schemes (farmer support programmes) are now being designed to specifically address market access and value chain issues through unique co-innovation arrangements to improve the farmer’s access to profitable international chains. A number of farmer support programmes (FSP) have been implemented in South Africa to reduce the risk of a lack of capacity and a lack of economic and/or financial experience in smallholder farms. Intervention measures have been instituted to these smallholder farmers to assist them to move out of poverty through agricultural production. The aim of this study was to understand the roles played by farmer support programmes in addressing income and welfare levels and sustainability of smallholder farmers in South Africa. Eighty nine (89) farmers were interviewed for this study and almost half (49%) of them received support from various organizations while 51% of the sampled farmers did not receive any support. The study was designed to compare the two groups between the treated and control group to assess the impact of these programmes.Using a Tobit and Propensity Score Matching technique, potential diffusion effects were eliminated between farmers supported by Farmer Support Programmes and farmers that did not belong to support services. The latter was selected from comparable communities with no agricultural support services. Findings from the Tobit regression and propensity score matching are consistent across the two methods, suggesting that being a member of any agricultural support programme has a significant positive impact on income and welfare of smallholder farmers.Farmer Support Programmes and collective marketing activities such as the collection and sale of members’ products appear to have a significant and positive impact on smallholder welfare of those farmers engaged in them. In the second analysis the study tested the types of arrangements that farmers would adopt to market their produce. From the results it was established that those farmers who were supported by institutional arrangements or FSP had better access to markets than those farmers who operated as individuals. Marginal effects are used to show the degree to which farmers chose a particular marketing channel or institutional arrangement that these farmers take when trying to access better paying markets. Then the final analysis is on factors that determine the extent to which collective action contribute to farmers’ income and market access. A number of variables (age, distance to the market, region the farmers are located) were evaluated using the multinomial regression model. Empirical results suggest that among South African cooperatives, those established in KwaZulu-Natal and partly in the Eastern Cape and upon the voluntary initiative of farmers are more sustainable and have access to better paying markets both locally and internationally than the other areas. The results also show that NGO-supported cooperatives have a longer life span than Government controlled cooperatives.","2013","2025-10-30 20:05:55","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:55","","","","","","","Sikwela (2013)","","","","Not applicable","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295184      DOI: No DOI","","","","Income; Smallholder Farmers; Farmer Welfare; farmer support programmes","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295184","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, CSA adoption remains low in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other developing regions due to resource constraints and weak agricultural extension systems, among other factors. To reverse this trend and increase CSA adoption, the use of participatory extension services like farmer extension facilitators (FEFs) are increasingly viewed as a pathway to improving extension services in rural communities in SSA and elsewhere. Yet, rigorous analyses of the impacts of the FEF approach as a pathway for CSA adoption remain limited. Here we estimate the impacts of the FEF approach on CSA adoption in terms of resource intensity of CSA practices promoted by FEFs through a large CSA-related intervention in southern Malawi. We apply recursive bivariate probit regression to primary survey data from a sample of 808 households across five districts in the project area across southern Malawi in 2016, accounting for endogeneity and selection bias in farmer interaction with FEFs and the impact of the FEF approach on CSA adoption. Results show that interaction with FEFs had a positive and statistically-significant impact on CSA adoption; low, medium, and high resource intensity CSA categories increased by 42%, 87%, and 96%, respectively. The results suggest that the FEF approach can significantly enhance CSA adoption and thereby contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, including climate action in Malawi, similar contexts in SSA, and elsewhere. Key Policy Insights Participatory extension systems like the FEF approach can improve agricultural extension services in poor communities and thereby enhance CSA adoption in such areas. Smallholder farmer interaction with FEFs can enhance their adoption of resource-intensive CSA practices.

In literature, the effectiveness of the TPEFAP on environmental conservation has been widely examined, while few pay attention to the effect of the TPEFAP on poverty alleviation, especially with the consideration of its spatial spillovers as well. In this paper, we utilize panel data covering the key ecological functional areas of China during the period 2011-2018 to evaluate the impact of the TPEFAP on poverty alleviation and also its spatial spillovers by employing the synthetic control method (SCM) and the dynamic spatial Durbin model, respectively. Specifically, we apply the entropy weight method (EWM) to calculate the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) and measure pro-poor effect in terms of MPI change. The results show that: (1) TPEFAP has stable positive effects on MPI in Hubei, Yunnan, Jilin, Gansu, and Ningxia, while the impact on Qinghai fluctuates. (2) MPI presents a significant spatial correlation. Furthermore, both the direct and indirect effects of TPEFAP on MPI are significant and stable positive, for both short- or long-term. (3) For potential channels, rural non-farm employment, rural labor mobility, and agricultural productivity are the key pathways through which the TPEFAP can alleviate poverty both in local and adjacent provinces. However, it is difficult to find significant positive spatial spillovers for the TPEFAP if only the natural resources scale is considered. This study indicates that the government should pay attention to the policy expectations of ecological poverty alleviation and, in future eco-compensation, must further increase the coverage of subsidies and diversify the forms of subsidies.","2022","2025-10-30 20:05:55","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:55","","","17","19","","","Qin (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295089","","","","Poverty alleviation; Synthetic control method; Spatial Spillovers; Ecological compensation; Transfer Payment Policy of National Key Ecological Functional Areas","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295089","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is very limited empirical evidence to support this promise. We use a large farm household survey of about 4000 smallholder farmers in Ethiopia growing cereals like teff, maize, wheat, maltbarley and sesame to examine the relationship between agro-clusters and smallholder wel- fare and poverty. Using instrumental variable estimators, we establish a positive association between agro-clusters, household income and per capita income. Agro-clusters are also shown to reduce poverty and poverty gaps. Our results are robust over different agro-cluster proxies and alternative estimators, such as the augmented inverse probability weighting estimator. We also show that our findings are unlikely to be driven by omitted variable bias. Moving beyond average effects and in the interest of understanding heterogeneous effects, we use quantile regressions at different income levels. We find that agro- clusters are associated with welfare gains for all house- holds. However, the most significant gains are observed for the wealthier households.

Kenya has seen rapid increases in electrification over the past few years, increasing grid access for Kenyan households from a rate of 25% in 2011 to 64.5% in 2018, according to Power Africa (2018). Despite this, there remain large inequities in electricity provision, with close to 95% of the population not having access to electricity in rural parts of the country (Willcox et al., 2015). While Kenya has a rapidly growing and innovative solar market, most of the large solar suppliers are concentrated in the western and central parts of the country, with limited supply networks in rural areas (Energy4Impact et al., 2018). Further, solar devices are relatively expensive products and even when products are available the poorest households will remain excluded due to the issue of product affordability.The GoK has made significant progress in building the National Safety Net Programme, which has expanded cash transfers to the most vulnerable segments of the population. In 2020, the GoK transferred Kenya shillings (KSH) 4,000 (approximately US$ 37) to over 1 million households on a bi-monthly basis. Over the next five years, the GoK has prioritised the ‘cash plus’ agenda, based on the assumption that the impacts on households’ well-being are greater if cash transfers are complemented and linked with other interventions and programmes. The ‘cash plus’ agenda hopes to help households to diversify their incomes, improve access to essential services, such as energy services, and improve their well-being in terms of education and health outcomes, among others.Object of the evaluationOxford Policy Management (OPM) has been contracted by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to conduct an independent evaluation of the GoK’s Mwangaza Mashinani pilot project. The Mwangaza Mashinani1 is an innovative pilot project that is designed to enhance energy access for the most vulnerable segment of the Kenyan population, to increase their well-being in terms of health, education, and livelihoods, with a particular focus on women and children. This is expected to be achieved by:• households reducing their use of kerosene and/or candles for lighting, resulting in a reduction in indoor air pollution and fire hazards, and, ultimately, a reduction in the prevalence of acute respiratory infections (ARIs), burns, and eye irritation;• children increasing the number of hours that they spend studying at night by using solar lighting, resulting in improved educational outcomes; and• households using the solar device to increase productive activity, diversify livelihoods, and reduce net energy expenditure, resulting in an increase in household income.Additionally, the pilot project seeks to develop markets for solar energy by increasing the penetration of solar products to previously underserved communities. This is expected to be achieved by providing incentives to participating solar suppliers to extend their networks into hard-to-reach areas by incorporating a de-risking mechanism into the project. The project is offering a guarantee to suppliers that it will pay 80% of the value of the device in the event of a household defaulting on their payments.The pilot project also aims to generate evidence on the impact of solar devices on households’ well-being, and to understand how a market for solar devices can be developed in underserved regions.1 Mwangaza Mashinani is Kiswahili for ‘light at the grassroots’.ixThe pilot project is designed to address the issue of affordability of solar products for the poorest segment of the population. The first phase of the pilot project targeted 2,000 vulnerable households in selected sub-counties in Kilifi and Garissa. The pilot project provided subsidies, through a bi-monthly cash top-up to households enrolled in the Inua Jamii cash transfer programme who wish to purchase a small solar device for lighting. The purpose of providing cash top-ups (subsidies) to purchase the device, rather than distributing free solar devices, is to foster a sense of ownership of the device among beneficiary households, as well as to avoid introducing distortions into the market for solar devices.Purpose of the evaluationThe primary purpose of this evaluation is to provide a summative assessment of the impact of the pilot project, and to generate scientifically robust evidence on whether and how the project has had an impact on the quality of life of children and their families in terms of education, health, and livelihoods. The evaluation also has a formative purpose, to improve the pilot project’s processes.Objectives of the evaluationThe primary objectives of the evaluation are to provide: i) an assessment of the relevance of the pilot project with respect to the needs of vulnerable households in Garissa and Kilifi; ii) an assessment of the impact on beneficiary households attributable to the pilot project, with a focus on women and children; and iii) an assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of the project implementation process, with a focus on operational lessons and recommendations for Phase 2, scale-up, and sustainability.Intended audienceThis evaluation has been produced for the GoK on behalf of UNICEF and with funding from Sida. The evaluation findings are of relevance to the Ministry of Public Service, Gender, Senior Citizens Affairs and Special Programmes, the Ministry of Energy (MoE), county governments in Kilifi and Garissa, the implementing consortium, and UNICEF. The evaluation findings are also intended to inform the international debate on the role of ‘cash plus’ programmes in poverty reduction.Evaluation design and methodsThe evaluation takes a theory-based approach, which methodologically guides the evaluation by drawing on the pilot project’s theory of change (ToC) to identify the key issues the evaluation should address. A mixed methods research framework was designed to answer the evaluation questions. This comprises the following:• A quantitative research study – to respond to questions regarding effectiveness and impact, and to support answers on relevance. This study is based on a quasi-experimental design and a quantitative household survey, which was implemented through an in-person survey at baseline and endline and a remote phone survey at midline.• A qualitative research study – to respond to questions regarding relevance and effectiveness, and to provide initial indications on sustainability. This study is based on interviews with community leaders, community-based project support structures, and beneficiary households.• An implementation review – to respond to questions regarding the relevance and effectiveness of the pilot project. This study is based on interviews with national-level stakeholders, including the GoK, UNICEF, and the project implementing consortium.• A value for money (VfM) study – to respond to questions regarding efficiency. This study relies on data from UNICEF and the implementing consortium.xMain findings and conclusionsRelevanceOverall, our findings suggest that the Mwangaza Mashinani pilot project’s objectives are relevant for the targeted households, solar suppliers, and the GoK. Specifically, the project’s aim to improve the affordability of small solar devices is relevant for the targeted households, who are found to lack access to modern energy sources for lighting and for charging mobile phones. Our findings confirm that, even at endline, affordability remains the key constraint on purchasing solar devices for these households.The project also aims to develop markets for solar energy by increasing the penetration of solar products in previously underserved communities. We find that the de-risking mechanism offered to the solar energy suppliers provides them with a sufficient incentive to explore new remote markets and to expand into underserved regions. We also find evidence of increased penetration of non-project solar devices in the surveyed communities, with a quarter of beneficiary households reporting owning another solar device besides the one supplied by the project. Compared to baseline, we found that a significantly higher number of households that had intended to enrol in the project but did not, and of households in the control sub-counties, own a solar device at endline.Finally, the project is aligned with the priorities of both the social protection and energy sectors in terms of supporting all Kenyans to live in dignity and achieving universal electrification, respectively.EffectivenessThe pilot project was able to register, target, and enrol over 2,000 vulnerable households in its first phase, with 1,692 households ultimately purchasing the solar devices. The project was also able to distribute solar devices and to deliver all six cash top-up payments to beneficiaries, including the final payment during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, along the delivery chain, the project has faced a number of challenges, many of which are due to weaknesses in outreach and communication, and, in particular, limited implementation of the behaviour chance campaign (BCC) component. The evaluation findings suggest that while households were aware that two devices were offered through the project, it is not clear that households made an informed selection. Further, we find that households struggled with the repayment process due to a lack of financial literacy or due to challenges using M-Pesa, in many cases requiring support from the village chiefs and community champions (CCs) to facilitate repayments. We also find that, as part of the enrolment process, almost half the households that enrolled in the project paid the commitment fee using money provided by project staff or family/friends.In addition, the pilot project relies heavily on the Inua Jamii’s delivery systems. While we find that targeting for the project was successful, with most households meeting the eligibility criteria, there was also the perception that not all vulnerable households had been included. By targeting beneficiaries of the Inua Jamii, the pilot project targets only vulnerable households that meet the Inua Jamii’s categorical targeting criteria, while also inheriting the Inua Jamii’s exclusion errors. Given the pilot project’s focus on enhancing access to modern energy for vulnerable households in underserved communities, a more inclusive approach to targeting, that covers both Inua Jamii and non-Inua Jamii households, could be better suited to achieving this objective.The Mwangaza Mashinani pilot project also piggybacks on the Inua Jamii payment systems, including in terms of timing. This means that challenges faced by Inua Jamii beneficiaries in accessing their regular payments are inherited by the project. In particular, payment delays are problematic for the pilot project, as households are not able to make timely repayments to the solar providers, resulting in their lights being switched off.xiImpactAt endline, the majority of households are using solar energy for lighting. As a result, the pilot project has had a positive and large impact on households’ access to better and more reliable energy for lighting, on their reduced reliance on other more polluting and lower-quality sources of lighting, and on their reduced spending on energy for lighting and charging mobile phones. Awareness of the benefits of solar energy among beneficiary households at endline is extremely high and has improved over time. There is also evidence of market creation effects of the project: the penetration of solar devices in the surveyed treatment and comparison communities has increased markedly over time.Households use the solar devices on a daily basis, mostly for supporting children’s study time, for productive unpaid activities, for charging mobile phones, and for providing light for security and socialisation. The use of the solar devices has also had unintended positive effects on beneficiary households’ social well-being, including a better sense of security provided by light at night, staying connected by having charged mobile phones and radios, and improved social capital within communities.The pilot project has had a positive and significant impact on the number of hours children spend studying outside school, and in particular at home during dark hours. Girls and boys spend equal amounts of time per day studying. The majority use the solar home system to study during dark hours. The pilot project has had a positive and significant impact on children’s school attendance and promotion to subsequent academic grades. There is no evidence of an attributable impact on the proportion of children regularly attending school.Despite an increase in the number of working household members and the number of productive activities households are engaged in over time, there is no evidence that the pilot project has had an attributable impact on these outcomes, or on households’ monthly income. At midline, we found a modest positive impact of the project on the number of working members and productive activities. However, this mid-term impact has not been sustained at endline. We also find that, while women are spending more time on productive activities – and specifically unpaid labour – compared to at baseline, and over half are using solar devices to conduct their productive activities during dark hours, there is no evidence that the pilot project has had an attributable impact on how women allocate their time to different activities. Reassuringly, we do not find unintended detrimental impacts on women’s time poverty.While the prevalence of symptoms of eye irritation and burns related to lighting fuel among household members has decreased over time, to reach very low levels at endline, there is no evidence that these improvements can be attributed to the pilot project. Households’ cooking habits remain a primary contributor to exposure to indoor air pollution.EfficiencyIn terms of coordination, our findings suggest that the pilot project is well-coordinated at the county level, through the county technical working groups, but that national-level coordination could be strengthened. The pilot project has been implemented using local structures that are also part of the Inua Jamii, and has set up its own structures to embed the project in the communities, although awareness of these structures is limited.In the evaluation period under review, the VfM performance of the pilot was consistent with the agreed standards for ‘good’ economy, ‘average’ efficiency, and ‘average’ cost-effectiveness. However, the expected VfM performance of the project at scale is on track to be ‘good’ for all three dimensions, including efficiency and some aspects of effectiveness, provided current performance levels are maintained and a number of specific conditions hold.In terms of economy, the pilot project has managed to minimise the transaction costs of the cash transfers, as well as operational and staff costs related to UNICEF’s activities. However, contractualxiiservices cost more than had been expected. While the project followed sound procurement practices in selecting the solar suppliers, the final cost of the solar products was above the budgeted amount.In terms of efficiency, the majority of activities have been implemented within budget, although the pilot project allocated more resources to set up and inception activities, as well as implementation, compared to the budget. This was due to delays in the procurement practices and challenges emerging from contextual factors, some unforeseeable. Despite the initial delays, by June 2020 most logframe targets had been achieved. Nonetheless, 22% of enrolled households decided not to purchase the solar device and 30% of beneficiaries did not make repayments for the device regularly.Finally, the pilot project meets the definition of providing ‘average’ cost-effectiveness in relation to education and energy. Excluding pilot-related costs, it is estimated that the cost of the project requires US$ 11.40 to be consumed to increase a child’s attendance in school by one day. Further, it costs US$ 2.30 to increase a child’s study time by one hour at night. In relation to energy use, Mwangaza Mashinani households are benefiting from an average of 3.4 hours of extra energy use per day. The cost-effectiveness indicator suggests that it costs US$ 0.13 for one extra hour of energy using solar devices as an extra source of energy, which is lower than the cost of using mini-grids as an alternative source of renewable energy.SustainabilityThe assessment of sustainability indicates there is a high degree of commitment to scaling up the pilot project by the national government. Stakeholders in the MoE, Social Protection Secretariat (SPS), and Directorate of Social Assistance (DSA) have endorsed the pilot project and are interested in scaling it up. The Kenya Off-Grid Solar Access Project (KOSAP) was widely mentioned as a potential vehicle for scale-up during the implementation review. Solar providers are also interested in exploring new markets.Evidence at the household level suggests that households would struggle with the costs of maintaining the solar devices or replacing them once they reach the end of their lifespan. Many beneficiary households at endline do not have a fully functioning device. Many households have also experienced maintenance issues with their device and have had to have it repaired, though it is not clear if these are minor or major repairs. Households indicated that they are willing to make minor repairs to their device, but they would struggle with making more substantial repairs or replacing their device if it breaks down, due to affordability concerns.The solar devices are expensive products for the target market and are highly subsidised by the project in order to ‘seed’ the market, create awareness, and overcome the issue of affordability. However, it is not clear how consumer affordability would be addressed in a scale-up scenario.Key recommendations• The GoK needs to clearly articulate the overarching policy objective of the project in order to determine which ministry, or combination of ministries, will scale it up.• To achieve the goal of universal access to minimum electric lighting services, the MoE will need to actively address demand-side constraints (e.g. affordability) on accessing off-grid energy.• The approach of drawing suppliers in to hard-to-reach markets through the project seems to have been effective. This market-based approach is important as regards providing households with access to repair services and spare parts, as well as access to higher-level products in the future.• It is imperative that a strong communication and engagement strategy is developed to strengthen the processes of communication, outreach, and sensitisation. This would ensure that beneficiaries and other stakeholders are aware of key project processes and resources at their disposal.• Project messaging should motivate children to use the solar lights to study at night, to strengthen this channel of impact.xiii• Gender should be explicitly incorporated into all stages of the project’s design and implementation. This could be achieved, for example, by following the United Nation’s Gender Equality and Social Inclusion framework, to systematically address issues related to gender and inclusion.• Given the crucial importance of making regular repayments in order to be able to use the solar devices, the project implementers should develop and document contingency protocols to guide implementation in the case of Inua Jamii payment delays.• There is a need to strengthen the project’s monitoring and evaluation processes by developing a monitoring and evaluation framework, improving the accuracy of the data that are collected, and utilising monitoring data to improve the processes of implementation.• The project design needs to be revised to better support households with the maintenance of devices. Without additional support, the endline findings suggest that there is a risk of mass failure of devices in the next few years (as batteries need replacing), resulting in solar waste.• The project implementers should revise the ToC to be realistic about what types of socio-economic impacts can be achieved, particularly in relation to health and livelihoods, and to explicitly capture the unintended, positive effects that occur for households in relation to social well-being.","2022","2025-10-30 20:05:55","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:55","","","","","","","Barberis (2022)","","","","not applicable","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295026      DOI: No DoI","","","","Sustainability; Vulnerable Populations; Universal Energy Access; Cash Plus Agenda; Solar Device Market Development; Summative Assessment","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295026","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, whether CSAP can promote county industrial structural upgrading (ISU) and propel high-quality economic development remains unanswered. Based on the panel data of counties in Sichuan Province, China in 2000–2016, this paper estimates the impacts of CSAP on ISU through difference-in-differences with variation in treatment timing (VTT-DID) and synthetic control method. The results show that: CSAP can improve the advanced level of county industrial structure. This finding remains valid after a series of robustness tests. Government guidance dominates the impacts of CSAP on ISU, while market regulation plays a limited role in the impact mechanism due to the presence of elite capture. Government guidance and market regulation have a positive synergistic effect. The ISU impacts of CSAP are affected by resource endowment, level of economic development, and culture difference of ethnic monitories at the county level. Mechanism analysis shows that CSAP mainly acts on county ISU by increasing capital accumulation. The research results provide a reference path for China to transform its concept of economic development, and the key evidence for the fact that CSAP is an important way to realize high-quality economic development and environment protection at the county level.","2022","2025-10-30 20:05:55","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:55","207-216","","1","61","","","Shi (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295117","","","","Difference-in-differences; Industrial structural upgrading (ISU); Synthetic control methods; Capital accumulation; Carbon sink afforestation project (CSAP)","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was found that households who planned to be out of poverty earlier had significantly higher incomes than those later, with transfer incomes contributing substantially to the income gap. The non-poverty-stricken households had much higher total income and significantly lower transfer incomes than the poverty-stricken households, including those that planned to be out of poverty earlier and those later.

Therefore, this paper aims to estimate VtP and the ability of LPs to reduce it. The analysis is based on the primary data collected in 2018–19 from 479 households in a tribal region of eastern&nbsp;India. First, household VtP was estimated using the feasible generalized&nbsp;least squares&nbsp;(FGLS) method. Households were categorized into four groups based on their current and predicted future poverty status: chronic poor, transient poor, escaped poverty, and non-poor. Second, factors influencing this movement of households from current to future poverty states were determined using multinomial logistic regression. Third, the impact of the LP on VtP was investigated using the endogenous switching regression (ESR) approach. The FGLS estimates show that 34.7% of households are vulnerable to future poverty, which exceeds the actual poverty rate of 28.6%. The major factors responsible for exacerbating chronic poverty and causing transient poverty are&nbsp;chronic illness, climate shocks, and the sale of assets. The ESR results indicate that a household’s VtP is reduced by 3% for those that participate in LPs. Although the LP evaluated in this study has an average positive impact in reducing vulnerability, there is wide heterogeneity among the beneficiaries as the geographically disadvantaged communities lag behind the others. Therefore, the study suggests strengthening such LPs with a particular focus on disadvantaged and vulnerable communities.","2022","2025-10-30 20:05:55","2025-10-30 20:06:23","2025-10-30 20:05:55","85-98","","","77","","","Khosla (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295092","","","","Impact evaluation; Social protection; Odisha; Endogenous switching regression (ESM); Livelihood program; Vulnerability to poverty","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295092","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analysed midline data collected in July–October 2019 from a&nbsp;randomised controlled trial&nbsp;(RCT) designed to measure the added impacts of the complementary programming in the Amhara and Oromia regions.

The project-level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) aims to standardize the measurement of women's agency and enable the assessment of impact over typical project timelines. Within the Food and Agricultural Approaches to Reducing Malnutrition (FAARM) cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Habiganj, Sylhet, Bangladesh, we examined quantitative pro-WEAI data collected from a subsample of trial participants and their husbands (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;885) approximately four months after the end of the intervention. We evaluated the impact of a three-year homestead food production program on men’s and women's agency separately by pro-WEAI domain and indicator, using multilevel logistic and linear regression. We show that women in the FAARM intervention group had levels of agency similar to men and much higher than women in the control group (Odds Ratio [OR] 7.7, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001), corresponding to better gender equity in intervention areas (OR 3.5, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001). The higher levels of agency among intervention women were driven by greater intrinsic and collective agency but not by instrumental agency. Compared to controls, more women in the intervention group found intimate partner violence unacceptable (OR 3.5, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001), had greater ownership of assets (OR 2.6, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.001), better control of income (OR 1.8, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.042), higher levels of group membership (OR 14.0, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001), and membership in groups they considered influential (OR 166.8, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001).

Our results contribute to the development of benchmarks for interpreting pro-WEAI scores across programs.

We find no evidence that PSNP participation improved technology adoption, time spent in agriculture, household-level ac- cess to agricultural services, or women's control over ag- ricultural assets. However, PSNP participation increased access to credit, the share of non-farm income, hours spent on casual work, community access to irrigation water, ownership of agricultural tools, community ser- vice in crop and livestock production, natural resource management, and access to credit.

Given the observed lack of impact on household-level agricultural outcomes, we recommend integrating household-level interventions, such as increasing the transfer size and provision of&nbsp;productive assets, that could lift household endowments above an asset threshold that would allow the productive use of community assets. This may boost the productive impact of the PSNP at the household level, facilitate agri- cultural development and economic growth.

For many years we have known that investing in FP also makes economic sense: every dollar invested in family planning can generate up to six dollars in savings for governments (USAID, 2006).And yet in 2020, global planning programs were at risk of a funding gap of more than $320 million in commodities alone (WHO, 2018). More than 200 million women and girls who said they do not want to get pregnant do not use modern contraceptives and more than 100 million pregnancies in low- and middle-income countries were unintended (Sully, et al, 2020).&nbsp;What more can we do to ensure that women and girls can and will voluntarily use contraceptives when they want to?Despite progress in addressing nonuse of contraception through traditional social and behavior change (SBC), these programs are limited by assumptions about what prevents women from using contraception. Mismatches persist between a woman’s personal preferences, the barriers she faces, and the interventions designed to help her voluntarily access and use FP correctly and consistently. The (re)solve project was designed to examine these barriers using behavioral science and to design, test, and evaluate products and services that address these barriers.Launched in 2016, (re)solve is a four-year cross- disciplinary project funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and led by Pathfinder International in partnership with Camber Collective, the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), and ideas42. (re)solve is active in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, and Ethiopia. The project used data on and insights into women’s and girls’ barriers to contraceptive use and nonuse to design and test a unique solution set in each country.In Burkina Faso, where we focused on unmarried girls, this solution set consisted of a participatory board game (La Chance) that corrected myths and misconceptions and increased pregnancy-risk perception; a health passport that eased girls’ access to health facilities; posters in health facilities that normalized consultations for adolescent girls; and name tags that identified youth- friendly health care providers. We also trained participating health care professionals on how to provide youth-friendly services and oriented them to the solutions and their rationale.We implemented the (re)solve solutions in 16 randomly selected secondary schools—eight each in Bobo- Dioulasso (Bobo) and Ouagadougou (Ouaga) — in 4ème and 3ème (grades 9 and 10 respectively). In each location, we trained 16 community-based facilitators to play the board games and distribute the passports. A total of 3,120 girls in grades 3ème and 4ème played&nbsp;La Chance&nbsp;between December 2019 and March 2020. Facilitators distributed 11,908 passports to girls in this timeframe.The impact evaluation examined whether the (re)solve package of solutions changed girls’ intentions to use contraception as well as other behavioral and attitudinal outcomes. We also evaluated the implementation process to understand how the solutions were carried out and perceived by stakeholders. We used a mixed-method cluster randomized trial (CRT) design. We conducted 2,372 quantitative surveys at baseline and 2,072 at endline (87.4 percent retention rate) with girls; 48 in-depth interviews with girls at baseline and 41 at endline; 35 endline in-depth interviews with implementing staff; and 14 endline key informant interviews with stakeholders.The results showed the following:The (re)solve solution set was found to be highly acceptable among adolescent girls and other key stakeholders, including health facility staff, game facilitators, and ministers.We found statistically significant differences in contraceptive attitudes and beliefs at endline between intervention- and control-school girls.A sizeable number of intervention-school girls went to a health facility for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information or reported an intention to visit a health facility.We saw a positive relationship between exposure to the intervention and intention to use contraception in the next three months, although it was not statistically significant.We believe the solution set holds promise and should be replicated. The solution set improved key attitudes and beliefs and significantly increased the number of intervention-school girls who went to the health facility for SRH information and received satisfactory services. The last outcome cannot be overstated within the broader context of provider bias toward adolescents seeking contraceptives.The report concludes with recommendations for future iterations, wrap-around services, and additional user groups for the solution set. We outline research questions for future iterations, which will ensure that the intervention, if and when scaled up, is informed by rigorous evaluations and research.Any scale-up efforts and future evaluations will require close coordination between and oversight from the Ministries of Health and Education to ensure successful integration and implementation. Behavioral solutions like the game, health passport, and posters can complement existing demand-generation interventions and connect youth to youth-friendly health facilities so they can make informed decisions that benefit them. Our integrated behavioral solutions are a humble but important contribution to Burkina Faso’s efforts to address adolescent health and wellbeing, enable adolescents to make healthy choices, potentially reduce the adolescent fertility rate among unmarried adolescents, and support policymakers’ efforts to reap the demographic dividend by investing in its most valuable asset: youth.","2020","2025-10-30 20:05:55","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:55","","","","","","","Hinson (2020)","","","","Other","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295046","","","","Family Planning Services; Burkina Faso; Adolescent Sexual Health","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295046","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this article aimed to examine the impact of a rural PSNP on household food security in the market district. By the probability sampling technique, 380 sample households and two rural PSNP technicians used as the primary data source, while secondary data were collected from the national report. The analysis was carried out with the help of descriptive analysis and econometric models. The study used Endogenous Switching Model (ESM) to analyze and examine the impacts of a rural PSNP on food security and identify factors that affect household participation in rural PSNP. Ten explanatory variables were included in the model to identify the determinant variable, of which seven are significant. The significant variable found to determine households’ participation in rural PSNP is age, livestock unit, labor force, cultivated land, off-farm income, and credit access by a level of confidence of 5% and 1%, respectively. The study findings showed that participation in rural PSNP only increases current consumption smoothing rather than future consumption, after graduating member households turn back into their previous living standards. Currently, food insecurity is one of the main challenges in the study area that requires immediate intervention to alleviate the problem. The PSNP is one of the integrated programs with the aim of helping food-insecure rural households become food-secure ones. Based on the finding, the study recommends that the program cash transfer should be increased and complementary community investment should be introduced. The limitation of some targeting criteria is an observed problem of the program in the study area. Due to certain criteria, poor households were excluded. Therefore, an adjustment of the criteria that had been taken to exclude poor households is necessary.","2023","2025-10-30 20:05:51","2025-10-30 20:06:27","2025-10-30 20:05:51","","","","14","","","Mustafa (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294918","","","","Food Consumption Score (FCS); Endogenous switching regression (ESM); Rural PSNP","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294918","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using data from a survey of households in Nyando basin in Kenya, we combine statistical matching and simultaneous equation econometric modelling, to evaluate pathways through which CSA practices impact on household asset accumulation and income. We find that uptake of multiple stress-tolerant crops improves household income by 83%, which in turn improves household asset accumulation. Impact pathway modelling also show that adoption of improved livestock breeds significantly reduces household income by 76%. For improved livestock, however, household income does not impact on asset accumulation, possibly because income is invested in form of livestock rather than household assets. These findings show that adoption of multiple stress-tolerant crops improves household assets accumulation via the income pathway. However, given an option, households would invest increased incomes in livestock assets, confirming that livestock are a form of savings, which can be liquidated to bridge household income gaps. This is a better resilience measure as compared to investment in domestic household assets.","2020","2025-10-30 20:05:51","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:51","","","","18","","","Ogada (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294907","","","","Africa; Kenya; Propensity Score Matching (PSM); Selection Bias; Household Incomes; Climate Smart Agriculture","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294907","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little empirical evidence exists with regard to the impact of SLCP on rural households' sensitivity to nature-induced changes and environmental challenges. In this study, household-level data covering the period 1995–2010 from five Chinese provinces were used to examine the effect of SLCP on farmers' sensitivity to climate change. The empirical results show that participation in SLCP significantly reduced farmers' sensitivity to climate change by reducing their dependency on land and natural resources for income, and by diversifying their livelihood options. Spatially, the results reveal that the effect of SLCP on farmers' sensitivity vary across regions. Specifically, SLCP was found to have a ‘rate effect’ on farmers in the Northern regions and a ‘level effect’ on farmers in the Southern regions. Likewise, we found that the effect of SLCP differs considerably across income groups, with the effect on low- and middle-income groups being most significant. The results indicate that subsidy is the main pathway through which SLCP reduces farmers' sensitivity to climate change. In contrast, we found inclusive evidence about the indirect effect of SLCP farmers' sensitivity through the promotion of non-agricultural employment. These results carry major implications with regard to the effectiveness of ecological conservation programs and their mitigation potential through building farmers' resilience in China and ecologically fragile environments.","2020","2025-10-30 20:05:51","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:51","","","","99","","","Liu (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294893","","","","sensitivity; Sloping Land Conversion Program; CLIMATE change; Livelihood diversity; Natural-resource dependency","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294893","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first chapter evaluates whether a financial policy to improve bank density in underserved areas in India benefited micro and small enterprises. The branch expansion policy targeted districts classified as underbanked, based on their ex-ante branch density, making the policy intervention suitable for a regression discontinuity design. Using a large nationally representative survey on informal MSEs located in districts within a narrow window around the threshold, this paper shows that enterprises in districts classified as underbanked witnessed large increases in revenue, gross value-addition, and productive capital in the aftermath of the reform. There was no change in credit access (from the bank and non-bank sources) for MSEs in underbanked districts. Our analyses reveal potential spill-over from industry linkages with formal enterprises. The second chapter applies recently developed ML methods to characterize the microentrepreneurs from extremely poor households who benefit (and who do not) from their participation in the Ultra-poor Graduation (UPG) model – a popular poverty alleviation program. Though previous studies have shown a large degree of heterogeneity in the treatment effect of the UPG model, the question of why some households benefit while others do not remains unanswered – mostly due to the limitations of conventional econometric models that do not allow using a rich set of baseline variables for treatment effect heterogeneity investigation. Applying recently developed machine learning methods on a large-scale RCT dataset from Bangladesh, this chapter address this problem and characterizes the UPG program participants who benefit and who do not. iii The results indicate a trade-off between wealth and consumption gains: some beneficiaries focused on accumulating assets while others increased their consumption. When profiling the top gainers on these two outcomes, the analyses show opposing characteristics between these two groups. The characteristics of the top gainers identified in this research can be used for improved targeting to maximize the impact of the UPG program on the desired dimension. Alternatively, the characteristics of those who failed to benefit can be used to customize the program interventions for balancing the asset and consumption trade-off. Finally, the third chapter, through a randomized control trial (RCT) setup, tested the individual and joint impacts of two types of messaging on the willingness to pay for fortified rice among low-income Bangladeshi consumers. The first type of messaging anchored the rice with a well-known high-value aspirational product. The second type established the credibility of its health benefits by connecting it to a well-known public distribution program. Drawing on insights from the marketing and consumer behavior literature, we argue that messages which position a product as aspirational or establish the credibility of its health benefits can increase consumer demand for the product. Indeed, the measured impact on WTP when both messages were combined was sufficiently large to elicit a price premium for fortified rice that would cover the cost of fortification. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting new evidence on the role of information in stimulating demand for a credence good.","2022","2025-10-30 20:05:51","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:51","","","","","","","Chowdhury (2022)","","","","Not specified","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294825      DOI: no doi","","","","India; Micro And Small Enterprises; Financial policies; bank density; underserved areas","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294825","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After implementing the poverty alleviation policy, the EEDCD of poverty-stricken counties on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau increased by approximately 66%. Based on the analysis of socioeconomic-related factors by geographic detector, it was found that population density changes, industrial structure changes, and fiscal expenditure had strong explanatory power for EEDCD change.","2023","2025-10-30 20:05:51","2025-10-30 20:06:30","2025-10-30 20:05:51","402–419-02–419","","4","30","","","Hua (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294999","","","","Difference-in-differences method; Economic-ecological  development coordination degree; Geographic detector; Poverty alleviation policy; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294999","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This report presents the impact evaluation findings of the first year of the Satellite Index Insurance for Pastoralists in Ethiopia (SIIPE) pilot programme. SIIPE was launched in March 2018 by the WFP Ethiopia Country Office (ETHCO) in collaboration with the Government of Ethiopia, the International Livestock Research Institute and the private sector. It aims to enhance the adaptability and resilience of pastoralist households in the Somali region of Ethiopia by insuring them against drought-related livestock risks.2. Climate change has increased the frequency of droughts over time. In the most recent drought prior to the launch of SIIPE (November 2016 to April 2017), an estimated 1.5 million livestock units perished in South(east) Ethiopia, threatening the livelihoods and food security of (agro)pastoral households. Against this background, SIIPE has provided livestock insurance to 5,001 beneficiary households in three districts of the Somali region. The insurance policies are offered by four companies partnering with SIIPE. All insurance holders are also beneficiaries of Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP), which provides cash or food payments against public works, and obtain SIIPE insurance coverage in exchange for public work days in addition to standard PSNP obligations. Insurance payouts would be triggered in scenarios of extreme drought as identified by a vegetation index calculated from satellite images.3. ETHCO commissioned this evaluation to improve the product and processes of the SIIPE pilot and to decide about its potential scale up. The specific objectives were to understand whether SIIPE brought about any behavioural change, if (and how) it provided greater protection to pastoralists against climate risk; as well as to measure the changes in well-being of individual households attributable to the programme.4. The main stakeholders and intended users of the evaluation include WFP (ETHCO, local offices in the programme areas, and the central Office of Evaluation), as well as the Somali regional government and the private sector partners. Methodology5. The evaluation was designed to assess the first year of SIIPE against the evaluation criteria of effectiveness and impact. The main evaluation questions were:EQ 1: Behavioural change: To which extent (and how) has SIIPE affected productive decisions and livelihoods of beneficiary households?EQ 2: Insurance awareness and understanding, and financial inclusion: Have programme activities and services led to improved awareness, understanding or use of insurance and financial tools and products?EQ 3: Livestock protection: To which extent (and how) has SIIPE strengthened the ability of pastoralists to keep their animals alive?EQ 4: Food security: Has the food security of pastoralists and their families improved as a consequence of the programme?6. These questions were answered through a mixed-method evaluation approach. The quantitative analysis estimated the programme effects on key outcome and impact indicators; it also provided descriptive insights into mechanisms and context. The impact estimates in this report are based on a quasi-experimental (propensity score matching) design that compares beneficiary households in pilot communities with comparable non-SIIPE Impact Evaluation Report, August 2019 vi | P a g ebeneficiary households in nearby communities1. Survey data were collected from approximately 400 households per study group. Qualitative evidence from group and individual interviews provided further insight into the impact pathways of SIIPE. Two waves of data collection were carried out. The baseline was conducted in January and February 2018, and the follow-up data collection in February and March 2019.7. The main limitations of this evaluation included the short study period, the absence of insurance payouts and the delayed implementation of some programme components. This report covers only the first year of the SIIPE pilot and can thus only identify short-term effects, which may differ from those in the longer term. Moreover, the fact that the index insurance was not triggered and did not pay out in the first year – even though pastoralists reported having experienced a prolonged drought – implies that the main effects of insurance in cushioning hardship and protecting assets by providing cash when needed could not be observed yet. Finally, a period of conflict in the study area led to delays in implementation of certain SIIPE activities, such as some public work activities and improvements in the filtering of satellite images. Due to this combination of factors, the quantitative impact analysis yielded only few statistically significant effects in the short run (but some additional results through qualitative analysis). Key findings of the evaluationThe results for EQ 1 show few behavioural changes at household level, but some effects at community level.8. The insurance coverage alone, without any payouts and livelihood training in the study period, has not increased livestock-related investment, income diversification or stability. The livelihoods of pastoralists continue to heavily depend on livestock and livestock sales. On a positive note, the programme has increased the likelihood that beneficiaries would rely on veterinary medicines and services to cope with drought.9. Positive effects of SIIPE are more evident at the community level. Communities reported clear benefits from the additional public work activities required for insurance coverage. These activities differ from the standard PSNP public works and have contributed to improved water and pastureland availability, as well as social cohesion. Under EQ 2, the programme has improved the awareness (but not the exact understanding) of insurance and SIIPE; it also fostered willingness to pay for livestock insurance and financial inclusion.In general, a relatively large willingness to pay for livestock insurance is reported, but this only applies to roughly half of the beneficiary households. The other half is not willing to pay anything, potentially leading them to abandon the insurance scheme if subsidies are phased out. SIIPE has maintained a higher share of beneficiaries willing to pay for livestock insurance relative to the control group.12. As a by-product of SIIPE, all insurance holders have been registered on a mobile money platform to process potential insurance payouts, but the actual use of these accounts has been limited so far. Nevertheless, this activity is an important first step towards further financial inclusion. EQ 3 has not found any systematic improvements in livestock protection but has revealed large livestock losses in the programme area.13. Insurance holders confirmed that they would spend their potential insurance payouts partially on livestock – albeit less than on food. However, this hypothetical behaviour could not be verified given the actual lack of payouts. A positive, albeit weak, behavioural effect on the use of veterinary medicine or services has been observed.14. Livestock accounting over the study period shows that the overall size of livestock herds owned by pastoralist households has not changed much since the baseline. Livestock losses (especially of sheep and goats) were large, amounting (on average) to one fifth of the baseline livestock or 500 USD in value. These losses were compensated through new animals born or received as gifts, but nevertheless underline the relevance of livestock insurance in the Somali region.15. There are indications that insured households have experienced more losses of livestock and had higher sales during the dry season than non-beneficiaries. This suggests that beneficiaries entered the dry season with the expectation of insurance payouts in case of hardship and therefore did not sell livestock early during the prolonged dry season. Households may have been tempted, because of the insurance, to wait longer during drought before taking action, leading to higher losses and sales. With insurance payouts, one would expect a positive effect on livestock protection in the long run. The results for EQ 4 show that food insecurity is a widespread concern that has not yet been mitigated through the programme.16. SIIPE has not yet stimulated the food intake, dietary diversification or food expenditure of pastoralist households. Again, no large effects can be expected since the insurance has not paid out and there have been no effects either on the intermediate outcomes towards better food security (income diversification, livestock protection).17. The descriptive analysis shows that households face on average moderate insufficiency of food intake. Children are on average modestly malnourished but with large variation in individual levels. While food insecurity is widespread, an even larger concern is low dietary diversity. Half of the women in reproductive age interviewed in beneficiary households consume only grains, a pattern that has been slightly reinforced through SIIPE, potentially to meet the calorie needs for the additional public work required from insurance holders. Recommendations18. The findings and conclusions of this evaluation led to the evaluation team making the following recommendations (divided in two large clusters and indicating high or medium priority):SIIPE Impact Evaluation Report, August 2019 viii | P a g eRecommendations on the insurance product19. R1 (high): Consider increasing the insurance coverage of risks other than pastures.20. Current insurance policy covers risks only for water, veterinary service and pasture risks, for the seasonal cover period of Gu season (for the index interval of March to June) and Deyr season (October to December). However, beneficiaries are interested that insurance covers the entire 12 months of a year, or not only ‘catastrophic’ but also medium risks.R2 (medium): Explain the limitations and risk of index-based insurance.21. Awareness raising activities of SIIPE should spell out more clearly the limitations and risks of index-based livestock insurance to prevent disappointments of insurance holders.R3 (medium): Continue addressing the basis risk issues in calculations of the vegetation index.22. Some interviewees suggested that the vegetation index may not accurately reflect actual drought conditions because, even during drought, certain areas are covered by evergreen plants and shrubs, but which are not edible by the animals. The filtering of satellite images should be adjusted to correctly account for this fact.Recommendations on other programme componentsR4: (high) Rigorously implement training and improve training materials.23. The training of kebele officials as trainers for final beneficiaries should be closely supervised to enhance the still limited understanding of SIIPE both among trainers and in the target population. New local officials (after replacements) should be trained as soon as possible. All training sessions should make use of improved materials such as those employed by ILRI for the training of higher-level SIIPE personnel.R5 (high): Conduct a follow-up data collection to capture the full programme effects.24. It is highly recommendable to carry out another follow-up household survey in 2020 or 2021 to capture the full long-term effects of SIIPE (including those of upcoming gender-specific activities), using the same control group design. This would require WFP to refrain from implementing programme activities in the current control communities. The data collection should take place around the dates when households collect their PSNP payments and can be easily located. Flexibility in the timing of the data collection is crucial, especially to wait until the first insurance payouts have been made.R6 (medium): Support the implementation and monitoring of public work activities.25. SIIPE public work activities have strengthened community assets, but their potential has not been fully exploited because of difficulties in their coordination and initialisation. WFP and its partner organisations should play an active role in fostering community participation in identifying relevant activities, provide advisory for their implementation and directly monitor the activities under SIIPE.R7 (medium): Foster the use of registered mobile money accounts.26. SIIPE has successfully registered beneficiaries on a mobile money platform, but these accounts have not been used much. It is recommended to stimulate their active use through adequate promotion and explanation of the detailed mobile banking functions, e.g. in the training sessions on income generating activities.","2019","2025-10-30 20:05:51","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:51","","","","","","","Markus (2019)","","","","United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294858      DOI: No DOI","","","","Food security; ETHIOPIA; Behavioural Change; Livestock Insurance; dietary diversification; Satellite Index Insurance for Pastoralists in Ethiopia","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294858","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This evaluation employs three methodologies: qualitative inquiry, pre-post comparison, and impact evaluation. The impact evaluation matches communities treated by SHOUHARDO III with untreated communities ex-post,using baseline stunting rates from the 2014 DHS dataset.The evaluation finds that the SHOUHARDO III project engaged more than 40% of households surveyed within target villages and successfully targeted poor and female-headed households. The analysis of baseline and endline statuses (pre-post analysis) of households in the SHOUHARDO III-targeted areas demonstrates that households from these areas improved across several indicators,including poverty levels, the nutritional status of women and children, women’s empowerment, and gender equity. From a qualitative standpoint, participants from areas where SHOUHARDO III appeared well-implemented offers insights into the potential of the interventions. The qualitative evaluation found mechanisms of change in several areas that can be built upon and enhanced.Qualitative findings show that the program succeeded in promoting multi-sectoral change at household and community levels. They also show that SHOUHARDO III effectively targeted services to the most food-insecure, Poor and Extremely Poor members of communities, and its multi-generational and gender-inclusive approach to its interventions facilitated community acceptance.From the impact evaluation, it is likely that we can credit SHOUHARDO III with improvements in women’s dietary diversity, women and children’s minimum acceptable diet, antenatal care access,and the increase in participation across several sectors. In addition, households in SHOUHARDO III villages experienced statistically significant differences in one resilience indicator, and households in program villages that experienced major shocks were better able to maintain their food consumption than similar households in comparison villages.However, the impact evaluation does not find meaningful differences between households in targeted communities and households in non-targeted communities in terms of women’s mobility and decision-making, children’s nutritional status (including child stunting and underweight status),children’s diarrhea, exclusive breastfeeding, household hunger, and improved use of health and nutrition services overall. Improvements in most measured conditions in the SHOUHARDO III program areas appear to have been matched by similar improvements in non-program areas,suggesting broader forces may account for them.Ultimately understanding differences between program areas and non-program areas can help inform decisions about future chapters of the SHOUHARDO III program and other development food security programs to ensure the most effective programs for vulnerable populations. Understanding the dynamics and mechanisms of change and responses of participants to interventions can also inform future work. Salient findings are also important to highlight for action. The research team concludes this report with recommendations.","2023","2025-10-30 20:05:51","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:51","","","","","","","Yishay (2023)","","","","not applicable","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294815      DOI: No DOI","","","","poverty; Food and Nutrition; Children & youth; Disaster preparedness; resilience and risk reduction","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294815","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four consecutive years of record flooding, alongside devastating drought, have led to widespread displacement, the destruction of livelihoods and the loss of arable land, which have all contributed to rising food insecurity. The effects of these concurrent climate shocks are compounded by rising food and fuel prices, and ongoing conflict.Against this background, the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have promoted an integrated approach to resilience building through a joint programme in South Sudan. Under this programme, communities and households are provided with sustained support in the form of a bundle of activities over four years with the aim of strengthening the ability of beneficiaries to withstand shocks.

It is of great significance to assess and summarise the effect of the soybean and cotton target price subsidy policy and to determine future policy direction. Using the national rural fixed-observation point socioeconomic sur vey data from 2009 to 2017, the study employed the difference-in-differences (DID) method to evaluate the impact of the target price policy (TPP) on rural household income in China. TPP had no significant impact on the total income of rural households. Specifically, TPP increased the farm income of rural households but simultaneously reduced the wage income and had no significant impact on the other income. Moreover, the impact of TPP on rural house hold income varied with the planting scale and income level; the effect of TPP was strong among the non-poor or scale operation rural households. TPP implementation affected rural household farm and wage income by affecting farmers’ allocation of working time and cost input. Therefore, implementing TPP should consider farmers’ partici pation in non-farm employment, further adjust the subsidy intensity and scope, and combine direct subsidies with the poverty reduction effect in poor areas. The contribution of this article is to explore the implementation effect of target price subsidy policies from the perspective of farmers’ income, to deconstruct farmers’ income, and explore the mechanism of policy action.

With observational data from 1383 surveyed households, we use an estimation strategy combining inverse probability weighting, regression adjustment, and two-stage least squares to address selection bias and omitted variable bias in two variables of interest. We find that while these two interventions are individually effective in alleviating poverty, their combination is not necessarily as effective. Our results show that commercialisation only reduces poverty among non supported households, while government supports are more effective among non-commercial households. This substitution of effects comes from the nature of support targeting and commercialisation. Households receiv ing supports often have lower capacity, making commercialisation ineffective or even impossible. Furthermore, current support policies are insufficient to enhance the impact of commercialisation. These results suggest that there could be more effective ways to combine external interventions and self-help efforts to better alleviate poverty.","2024","2025-10-30 20:05:39","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:39","1-24","","","","","","Hoang-Duc (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294781","","","","Multidimensional Poverty; Commercialisation; Anti-poverty policy","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294781","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The e-commerce to the countryside policy has energized the rural economy, helping to improve household economic resilience and reduce income stratification, thereby promoting the inclusive and sustainable development of the digital economy. Drawing on panel data collected from rural fixed observation points in Henan Province during 2009–2022, this study employs a staggered difference-in-differences (DID) approach to evaluate the impact of China’s e-commerce to the countryside policy on farmers’ income and income inequality. The empirical results reveal that the rural e-commerce policy significantly increases farmers’ income while mitigating income inequality. The underlying mechanisms function through three synergistic pathways: industrial structural upgrading, manifested through tri-sector integration driven by rural enterprise development; factor allocation restructuring, evidenced by productivity gains from optimized labor–capital reallocation; and enhanced market inclusion through digital technology empowerment that lowers participation barriers. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the e-commerce to the countryside policy exhibits pro-poor characteristics, with its income-enhancing and equalizing effects being particularly pronounced in agricultural areas, traditional villages, county-level civilized villages, underdeveloped regions, registered poverty-stricken villages, and households with low human, physical, and financial capital endowments. These findings confirm the inclusive development efficacy of rural e-commerce among vulnerable populations. Consequently, the study provides a replicable policy implementation framework for achieving common prosperity objectives.","2025","2025-10-30 20:05:39","2025-10-30 20:06:32","2025-10-30 20:05:39","","","10","17","","","Lv (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294726","","","","Income Inequality; Rural revitalization; Common prosperity; Rural e-commerce","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294726","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Nobo Jatra project was implemented by World Vision and local partners in the southwestern coastal areas of Bangladesh in the Khulna and Satkhira districts and aimed to address the underlying causes of chronic food insecurity by improving knowledge, capacity, links to food production and income generation and facilitating improvements in household assets and savings. A quantitative survey was conducted in 108representative villages in southwest Bangladesh and captured information on farming, health,nutrition, resilience, and consumption. Half of these villages were treatment villages and half were comparison villages. In-depth qualitative data was collected from four treatment villages where the project was well implemented and the community engaged. The quantitative data analysis allows us to look at indicators in treatment villages before and after the project was implemented, as well as compare the experiences of treatment and comparison villages. The qualitative data allows us to understand the potential of the interventions when well-implemented, as well as how and why they worked or did not work as intended.The pre-post evaluation shows improvement across a large number of indicators between baseline and endline in treated villages, although it suggests that more help is needed for increasing nearby access to water, helping women earn more cash, supporting female farmers,and supporting households with adult-only women. The qualitative study provides insights into the mechanisms that led to these improvements, and key challenges for indicators showing limited results.The analysis of the treatment and comparison villages suggests little difference between treatment and comparison villages in child stunting and underweight status, and higher child diarrhea rates in treatment villages. However the analysis also shows more children receiving a minimally acceptable diet in project areas, greater women’s autonomy and empowerment, and households in treatment villages better able to maintain their food consumption in the face of shocks. Qualitative analysis in villages with the most comprehensive programming highlights achievements across nutrition, food security, income, and disaster preparedness outcomes, as well as the pathways by which these outcomes occurred. This included unexpected insights into the ways interventions affected income and the effects of increased income. Furthermore,the project strengthened local input and service provisioning systems in best-case scenario villages, but future sustainability of these systems varies by sector. The qualitative study also found that Nobo Jatra’s interventions strengthened household resiliencies and food security,helping households during recent natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic.","2023","2025-10-30 20:05:39","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:39","","","","","","","Yishay (2023)","","","","not applicable","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294813      DOI: No DOI","","","","Food security; Water; sanitation and hygiene; Food and Nutrition; Children & youth","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294813","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research focused on how life skills training could supplement more traditional humanitarian response packages consisting of asset transfers and technical assistance. Life skills curriculum focused on topics related to financial health best practices, such as how to manage household finances and debt, were delivered to households to address the complex financial realities of managing household resources. A randomized controlled trial was carried out to measure the direct impact of this training. A subset of the target population of 1,510 households were randomized to receive life skills training across 34 implementation clusters across three local government areas (LGAs) in Borno State of Northern Nigeria, specifically Damboa, Dikwa, and Gwoza. In parallel, costs were measured for the life-skills training component in order to measure cost-efficiency of this approach. Participants receiving life skills training were observed to have higher self reported levels of confidence around being able to borrow and manage debt. Participants also reported saving a larger proportion of their income as well as investing in small ruminants when compared to the control group. Little to no difference was found between other measures of behavior and there were no significant links between the training and higher level food security and economic outcomes. Despite initial investment costs to tailor the training to the Nigerian context, the overall cost of the training along with the ability to readily scale suggests that the activity is a cost-efficient means for improving financial awareness and behavior. However, a cost-effectiveness analysis of higher level food security outcomes was not conducted given that there was no measured, positive impact on food security outcomes.","2024","2025-10-30 20:05:39","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:39","","","","","","","Macaranas (2024)","","","","Other","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294811","","","","Nigeria; Conflict-affected; Food Assistance; Livelihood Training; Internally Displaced Persons (IDP)","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294811","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focusing on the period 1986 to 2010, I construct plausible counterfactuals for counties that participated and graduated from the NPCs registry using the synthetic control method. This exercise reveals several new insights. First, on average, graduates of China’s anti-poverty program exhibit roughly the same growth outcomes as those still receiving support from the program. Second, I show that focusing on the average impact masks sizable heterogeneity when disaggregating to a case by case analysis of counties. Importantly, for the subset of counties which graduated from the first wave of the poverty reduction program in 1993, there is a demonstrably faster expansion post-graduation. For more recent county’s graduating from the program, however, I find significantly lower income growth of NPCs program completion in the long run.","2024","2025-10-30 20:05:39","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:05:39","1-35","","","","","","Duan (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294789","","","","China; POVERTY reduction; Synthetic control method; Anti-Poverty Programs; Lasting impacts","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121294789","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fiscal funds allocated for poverty alleviation have significantly contributed to reducing poverty in impoverished areas. However, to date, there has been a lack of scholarly research specifically examining the effects of these fiscal poverty alleviation funds on both poverty reduction and economic growth. This study aims to address two key questions: What role do fiscal poverty alleviation funds play in reducing poverty? Additionally, do these funds contribute to economic growth? Design/methodology/approach– Provincial panel data in China from 2010 to 2020 are used to test the impact of fiscal poverty alleviation funds on poverty reduction and economic growth. The empirical study of this paper primarily employs panel data within difference and two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation for causal identification. Findings– Poverty alleviation funds positively influence China’s economic growth and significantly reduce the rural poverty rate. During the sample period, the contribution of poverty alleviation funds to economic growth reached 7.3%, and the contribution to the reduction of the poverty incidence rate was 8.4%. Originality/value–The keycontribution of this study lies in its novel approach of using empirical methods to probe the impacts of fiscal poverty alleviation funds on provincial economic growth.

However, evidence of long-term employment trajectories is limited, and it is crucial to understand whether the program truly has a transformative long-term income effect. We evaluate the long-term impact of TUP on employment using difference-in-differences techniques on panel data from a 9-year period (2002–11). We confirm earlier findings of the positive short-term TUP impact: participants are more likely to switch from less productive occupations (e.g., working as maids, begging, day laboring) to entrepreneurship (up 10 percentage points) and generally maintain these new occupations for the medium term. In the long term, however, a substantial proportion of participating households—especially those with members starting out as beggars or maids, those without adult sons, and those headed by males—are switching back to their lower-income baseline occupations, causing the long-term impact to be smaller (a 5 percentage point increase). As this paper is the first to provide impact estimates over a 9-year period of the TUP program, the findings highlight the need for further research on the causes for this reversal and the extent to which it is found in other settings.","2019","2025-10-30 20:05:39","2025-10-30 20:06:36","2025-10-30 20:05:39","","","1","6","","","Misha (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058359","","","","Livelihoods; Big Push; Income-Generating Activities; Ultra-Poor; BRAC; Targeting; Doubly Robust Estimation; Graduation From Poverty","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058359","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"XZG4GR5J","report","2017","Banerjee Abhijit; Karlan Dean; Osei Robert; Thuysbaert Bram; Udry Christopher","Graduation From Ultra Poverty In Ghana","","","","","http://www.3ieimpact.org/sites/default/files/2018-08/3ie%20Grantee%20Final%20Report%20OW2.206.pdf","Executive Summary - More than one fifth of the world's population lives on less than US$1.25 per day. While many credit and training programs have not been successful at raising income levels for these ultra-poor households, recent support for livelihoods programs has spurred interest in evaluating whether comprehensive “big push” interventions may allow for a sustainable transition to self-employment and a higher standard of living. To test this theory, in six countries researchers evaluated a multi-faceted approach aimed at “graduating” the ultra-poor from poverty. They found that the approach had long-lasting economic and self-employment impacts and that the long-run benefits, measured in terms of household expenditures, outweighed their up-front costs. Here we summarize the Ghana site, which had similar effects as the other successful sites. Policy Issue: More than one fifth of the world's population lives on less than US$1.25 per day. Many of these families depend on insecure and fragile livelihoods, including casual farm and domestic labor. Their income is frequently irregular or seasonal, putting laborers and their families at risk of hunger. Self-employment is often the only viable alternative to menial labor for the ultra-poor, yet many lack the necessary cash or skills to start a business that could earn more than casual labor. In the past, many programs that have provided ultra-poor households with either credit or training to alleviate these constraints have not been successful at raising household income levels on average. However, in recent years, several international and local nongovernmental organizations have renewed their support for programs that foster a transition to more secure livelihoods. Combining complementary approaches—the transfer of a productive asset, training, consumption support, and coaching— into one comprehensive program may help spur a sustainable transition to self-employment. To better understand the effect of these programs on the lives of the ultra-poor, researchers conducted six randomized evaluations in Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru. Context of the Evaluation: In Ghana, researchers partnered with implementing organizations Innovations for Poverty Action and Presbyterian Agricultural Services (PAS). The study took place in in the Northern and Upper East regions of Ghana, a region that is disproportionately poorer than the coastal south. Fifty-three percent of households in the study were living on US$1.25 a day or less when the study began, compared to 29 percent in Ghana as a whole. To select the poorest members of the communities, the project team conducted a Participatory Wealth Ranking, in which villagers collectively ranked households according to their wealth during a community meeting. PAS conducted a short survey afterwards to verify the results of the ranking. Details of the Intervention: Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of a two-year comprehensive livelihoods program (“the Graduation approach”) on the lives of the ultra-poor in northern Ghana. The approach was first developed by the Bangladeshi NGO BRAC in 2002 and has since been replicated in several countries. The Graduation program consisted of six complementary components, each designed to address specific constraints facing ultra-poor households. In Ghana, researchers first randomly assigned villages composed of a total of 2,606 households, to one of two groups. One group served as a pure comparison group and was not offered the program. In the other group, 666 households were randomly assigned to receive the program. The other half of the households in that group did not receive the program, and served as a sub-comparison group to measure “spillover” effects on non-participating households living nearby. The program consisted of six complementary components, each designed to address specific constraints facing ultra-poor households: 1. Productive asset transfer: One-time transfer of a productive asset valued at GHS 300 (2014 PPP US$451). Forty-four percent of participants chose goats and hens, roughly a quarter picked goats and maize inputs, and small number picked shea nuts and hens (6 percent). 2. Technical skills training: Training on running a business and managing their chosen livelihood. For example, households who selected livestock were taught how to rear the livestock, including vaccinations, feed and treatment of diseases. 3. Consumption support: During the lean season (14 out of 24 months), households received weekly cash transfers of GHS 4-6 (2014 PPP US$6.02- 9.03), depending on household size. 4. Health: Households were enrolled in the National Health Insurance Scheme and received health and nutrition education. 5. Savings account: Half of the Graduation households received savings accounts through the Savings Out of Ultra Poverty (SOUP) program, also implemented by PAS. When PAS staff made their weekly visits, they collected deposits and households logged deposits. 6. Households visits: Weekly visits by PAS staff to provide to provide accountability, coaching, and encouragement. In order to test the relative effectiveness of the savings and asset transfer component, the researchers also randomly assigned a portion of households (733 households) to only receive the SOUP program, while another portion (329 households) only received the asset transfer component of the program. Half of those in the SOUP program (362 households) received a 50 percent match on their savings to test the impact of incentives to save. Researchers conducted the first endline survey immediately after the two-year program ended, as well as a second endline survey around one year later. Results and Policy Lessons: Note: Results forthcoming from the relative effectiveness of the savings component (with and without incentives) and an asset transfer-only treatment. Across all six countries, researchers found that the program caused broad and lasting economic impacts. Treatment group households consumed more, had more assets, and increased savings. The program also increased basic entrepreneurial activities, which enabled the poor to work more evenly across the year. While psychosocial well-being improved, these noneconomic impacts sometimes faded over time. In five of the six studies, long-run benefits outweighed their up-front costs. In Ghana, households that received the Graduation program saw similar effects one year after the program ended: Economic impacts: Average total monthly consumption among treatment households was 2014 PPP US$33.62, an 11 percent increase over households in the comparison group. They spent $22.41 on food every month on average, 12 percent more than the comparison group. Households saw significant increases in asset holding and borrowed 58 percent more than those in the comparison group (2014 PPP US$35.60 monthly average), They also saved 2014 PPP US$16 a month on average, which was three times more than households in the comparison group. Self-employment: Households experienced a 91 percent increase in non-farm income, earning 2014 PPP US$12.86 on average, as well as significant gains in livestock revenue, earning 2014 PPP US$40.60 a month on average, or 50 percent more than the comparison group. Psychosocial wellbeing: Households that participated in the program did not report feeling significantly less stressed or happier than households in the comparison group. Political involvement: Women in treatment households did not experience significant gains in empowerment in Ghana, and in fact experienced significantly less power in decisions about food in the household. However, treatment households did participate in more community meetings than those in the comparison group. Cost-benefit analysis: Researchers calculated total implementation and program costs to be US$1,777 per household (2014 PPP US$5,408). However, estimated benefits of consumption and asset growth amount to 2014 PPP US$7,175 per household, representing an overall 133 percent return on investment.","2017","2025-10-30 20:05:39","2025-10-16 09:32:59","2025-10-30 20:05:39","1-61","","","","","","Banerjee (2017)","","","","3ie Grantee Final Report","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058368      DOI: No DOI","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\NJU66XEK\121058368.pdf","","Financial Literacy; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Health Impact; Economic Impact; Non-Farm Income; 6 Country Evaluation","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058368","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2016, Bill Gates promoted investment in chickens as a development strategy that would meaningfully increase incomes for poor women.1 In response, Chris Blattman suggested that large cash grants of the kind provided by Give Directly (Haushofer and Shapiro 2016) may be more effective at enhancing outcomes, given heterogeneity in households' needs and capacity to raise chickens.2 This learning brief reports on evidence from an ongoing impact evaluation of a complementary program to Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program, Phase 4 (PSNP4), called SPIR (Strengthen PSNP4 Institutions and Resilience) in rural Ethiopia, in which a cross-randomization of interventions providing poultry and cash transfers allows us to generate evidence highly relevant to this debate. The SPIR Development Food Security Activity (DFSA) in Ethiopia is a five-year program (2016–2021) supporting implementation of the PSNP4 as well as complementary livelihood, nutrition, gender, and natural resource management activities intended to strengthen the program and expand its impacts. Under funding from USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and in close collaboration with the Government of Ethiopia, World Vision leads implementation of the SPIR DFSA in partnership with the Organization for Rehabilitation and Development in Amhara (ORDA) and CARE. SPIR DFSA targets more than 500,000 PNSP clients in 15 of the most vulnerable woredas in Amhara and Oromia regions of Ethiopia.

Its second phase, CLP-2, started in April 2010 and ended in April 2016.  The core objective of CLP-2 was to reach 78,000 participant households and to lift 85% of those out of extreme poverty. The wider objectives were to create sustainable livelihood opportunities for households, to spur overall local economic development, to reduce vulnerability, and to achieve sustainable graduation out of extreme poverty.  Achieving these objectives required addressing several extreme and char-specific constraints. To do this, CLP-2 devised a complex system of several interrelated interventions. These focused on four key areas: infrastructural activities, livelihood activities, market development activities, and human development activities.  The UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Australian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) commissioned this evaluation in order to assess the effectiveness of CLP-2 in achieving its objectives, to analyse the sustainability of CLP-2’s impact, and to draw lessons from CLP-2’s experiences for future programming. More specifically, the evaluation focused its efforts around the priority areas of CLP-2 graduation, poverty, livelihoods, sustainability, efficiency, and perceptions on changes to the local economy. The specific questions asked in this evaluation are listed in the table below. Methodology  Mixed methods approach  This evaluation has been implemented with the explicit goal of integrating quantitative and qualitative research approaches and results. Throughout this evaluation we have aimed to closely integrate quantitative and qualitative components of the evaluation. The qualitative component included primary data collection in CLP-2 areas. The quantitative component included analysing CLP-2 household survey data – making use of advanced econometric techniques (PSM, panel regression analyses) to address questions of CLP-2 impact. However, not all questions could be answered using insights from both components.  Graduation from CLP-2 programme  CLP-2 developed a programme-specific indicator to assess how participant households ‘graduate’ out of poverty. Graduation out of poverty generally relates to the idea that households sustainably move onto a path of improving livelihoods and wellbeing and out of extreme poverty. The CLP-2 graduation criterion is a composite index that covers several dimensions of participants’ lives: income, savings, nutrition, assets, the status of women, vulnerability, and access to services. If a household meets six out of the 10 underlying criteria within three months of the end of programme support, it is considered to have graduated.  Our analysis shows that the proportion of participant households meeting the graduation criterion has consistently increased over time. Across cohorts, in October 2015 the proportion of households that achieved the graduation criterion was around 90%. This translates into over 276,000 individuals living in participant households that can be considered to have graduated using this criterion. There is significant variation in how easily households meet the various underlying criteria of the graduation criterion, with savings, income sources, and access to water being the most difficult criteria to meet.  Economic wellbeing: Poverty and income  We use four main indicators in order to assess how the economic wellbeing of participant households has changed due to CLP-2. First, consumption poverty – defined as the proportion of participant households with consumption levels under the lower rural Rangpur poverty line. Second, the consumption poverty gap. This indicates the average distance in consumption levels of poor households from the minimum consumption level needed to be considered non-poor. Third, asset poverty, which indicates whether households hold assets with a value below the 30th percentile of the comparable rural Rangpur distribution. Fourth, reported yearly household income in Bangladeshi taka (BDT). CLP-2 Longitudinal Monitoring and Independent Impact Assessment – Final Report – Volume I  e-Pact iii  Our analysis indicates that, as measured using all four indicators, the economic wellbeing of participant households improved significantly after receiving CLP-2 support for one year—a change that was sustained until after direct support from CLP-2 to households ended.  In terms of consumption poverty, three to five years after the start of CLP support the poverty rate among participant households was on average 37 percentage points lower than without support. This translates into about 113,000 individuals lifted out of extreme poverty due to CLP-2 across all cohorts. A significant and sustained decrease of, on average, 12 percentage points in the poverty gap from one year after CLP-2 support started onwards also indicates that even for households that did not move over the poverty line wellbeing improved significantly.  Similarly, asset poverty decreased by 36 percentage points for participant households after one year into the programme. Reported per capita income in participant households also increased by over 5,000 BDT after one year of CLP-2 support. In both cases, changes were sustained further down the timeline.  Why do positive changes differ between households?  Our research has identified several factors that either hinder or support participant households in regard to benefitting from CLP-2 support, and hence improving their wellbeing. These were analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively.  In terms of inhibiting factors, exposure to severe floods and erosion is a key factor negatively affecting a household’s ability to benefit from CLP-2. This is despite the efforts  under CLP-2 to mitigate the severity of such shocks via, for example, raising households on plinths or erosion grants. We find both qualitative and quantitative evidence for severe negative consequences of erosion and floods. Our analysis indicates, however, that over time the resilience of participant households to these shocks increases as the ability and strategies used to prevent, mitigate, and cope with shocks improves.  In addition, qualitative evidence indicates that weak links and communication systems with the mainland are seen as preventing households from fully benefitting from CLP-2 support. This is because such weak links prevent households from having access to markets, traders, basic services, and government officials, which are seen as important in order for households to improve their wellbeing.  Finally, certain household characteristics inhibit households from benefitting from CLP-2. Such characteristics are high dependency ratios, female household headship, having many daughters of marrying age, and high levels of debt when entering the programme. We find both quantitative and qualitative evidence for such negative effects.  In terms of supporting factors, the main ones that our qualitative research identifies are a combination of diversification of household income sources with low dependency ratios, access to loans and reinvestment of savings into productive assets, and positive intra-household dynamics where household members jointly work to manage assets and income-generating activities. CLP-2 Longitudinal Monitoring and Independent Impact Assessment – Final Report – Volume I  e-Pact iv  Savings and assets  Initial descriptive quantitative analysis has shown that participant households exhibited low average levels of cash savings, but with high variations in these levels across households. One of the key triangulation goals of the qualitative research was to see whether this finding is supported and to investigate how savings were conceptualised among participant households and how saving behaviour changed due to CLP-2.  A key finding of this research is that CLP-2 participants conceptualise saving not just as a cash accumulation strategy, but as part of a broader financial strategy that includes reinvestment in assets, such as jewellery and productive assets that can be easily  liquidated. Such assets could be, for example, poultry. When households save cash, they mostly do so through village savings and loans groups (VSLs).  Our quantitative analysis of programme impact corroborates these findings. We do find significant increases in cash savings that can be ascribed to the CLP-2 intervention. However, these increases are low and, on average, do not exceed 3,000 BDT even after three to five years of CLP2 support. Interestingly, we find that cash savings for female-headed households do not increase at all. On the other hand, the total value of assets held by households not only increased significantly (by over 29,000 BDT) after one year of CLP-2 support, but continued to expand to an increase of over 46,000 BDT compared to baseline after three to five years.  In addition, when looking at the relative distribution of values held by households in terms of cash and other assets, we find that over the course of CLP-2 participation the importance of cash to store value decreases. Households prefer to store value in assets – in particular in land – as time progresses. Again, this corroborates the qualitative finding that households perceive storing value in assets as a saving strategy.  Our qualitative research also shows that participant households save for four main reasons: first, to mitigate against shocks to the household. Second, to invest in new assets and new incomegenerating activities. Third, to be able to invest in the accumulation of human capital. Finally, to save for any sizeable expenses that require larger amounts of cash, such as, for example, bulk purchases of food.  Interestingly, the qualitative research also found that saving behaviour, such as participating in VSLs, has been taken up by non-participants. Moreover, savings groups have shown to be surprisingly resilient to shocks, and across time.  Changes in the local economic context  Key CLP-2 interventions  The qualitative research component also explored changes that have occurred in the local economic context of participant households, in particular with regard to engagement with markets and service providers. Under the assumption that an improvement in the local economy would benefit participant households further CLP has attempted to change the local economic context through a combination of demand and supply side interventions. On the demand side, the interventions aimed at improving the rearing and agricultural practices of CLP-2 households, thereby increasing the demand for functioning markets. On the supply side, market development CLP-2 Longitudinal Monitoring and Independent Impact Assessment – Final Report – Volume I  e-Pact v  initiatives aimed to create value chains that would enable chars dwellers to sell products and produce for the wider economy.  Our research shows that the demand side interventions increased the volume and diversity of agricultural output on the chars. These improvements were mentioned more widely by female participants, who were particularly appreciative of the new skills they had learned. The exact materialisation of these changes varied by research site. For example, differences in soil quality affected changes in agricultural practices. Similarly, cultural norms sometimes affected the way in which women could participate in increased production. In general, respondents indicated that following CLP-2 rearing practices would lead to an increase in returns on their assets.  In addition, our research shows that participants and non-participants make use of livestock service providers (LSPs) – even after CLP-2 support in a certain area ends. The exact way in which participant households do this, however, varies across research sites. For example, factors such as remoteness and limited accessibility remained a challenge for LSPs in regard to offering services. With respect to access to traders (for agricultural output) and input dealers, our qualitative research points to variation across research sites. Differences were partly due to differences in the distance from chars to other markets.  CLP’s market development initiatives focused on facilitating the emergence and operation of dairy, meat, and fodder markets. Key elements were setting up char business centres (CBCs) and char input dealers (CIDs). Our research suggests that both CBCs and CIDs were partly effective in improving market linkages by building the capability of producers, dealers, and traders, and promoted organised production groups that were trained to engage with and identify business opportunities. However, respondents often expressed the view that this approach might not have gone far enough and more widespread and deliberate supply side interventions might have increased CLP-2’s impact and sustainability.  Women and markets  Our qualitative research indicates that women in the chars typically do not visit markets on the mainland, as doing so contradicts cultural norms. However, on the chars themselves, changes have taken place and women now actively engage with traders visiting the chars, small shops, or markets on the chars.  Spillovers to non-participants  The qualitative research found strong evidence that non-participants have adopted the farming and livestock rearing practices promoted by CLP-2. Similarly, non-participants reported making use of the services of LSPs, but to a lesser extent.  Empowerment and voice  Our qualitative research also investigated issues around the empowerment and voice of char dwellers. A particular focus was female empowerment and how the situation of women on the chars has changed due to CLP-2 activities. Evidence emerged of four broad areas of empowerment. CLP-2 Longitudinal Monitoring and Independent Impact Assessment – Final Report – Volume I  e-Pact vi  Social empowerment  First, there is some quantitative evidence that the status of women has improved within their households, especially in regard to participation in decision-making. However, qualitative evidence points to a more nuanced improvement in this respect, in that women now participate in the  decision-making process without necessarily having the final say. In addition, women now actively engage in activities outside their houses. However, this is limited to the char they live on. Moreover, women actively and morally support one another against injustice and violence. There is also an increased awareness of the negative effects of girls’ child marriage – although changes with respect to the actual practice seem to be limited. Respondents also reported that the frequency of domestic violence has decreased on the chars. Finally, overall, there is a general perception that Village Development Committees (VDCs) acted as empowerment vehicles – in particular for men. Respondents reported that members of those groups continued to raise issues on community development within the community and with local government.  Economic empowerment  The transfer of the assets provided by CLP-2 to women in the household directly increases female empowerment among participant households – and allows them to directly earn  income. There is some qualitative evidence that participant households, over time, invest in assets controlled by men. In general, as corroborated by other evidence, economic opportunities to engage in meaningful economic activities have increased across the chars due to CLP-2.  Political empowerment  Our qualitative research also points to changes in the level of political empowerment that  households experience on the chars. First, respondents reported that char dwellers now face less stigmatisation from mainland dwellers, politicians, and service providers than before CLP-2 support. Second, char dwellers now actively engage with local government and demand services and law enforcement support. Finally, char dwellers are registered as voters and are hence more likely to receive support and services from government officials.  Efficiency  Questions related to targeting and VfM were addressed quantitatively in this evaluation. In terms of targeting, we find that CLP-2 generally had low levels of inclusion error. Over 90% of all participant households could be considered extremely poor at baseline.  In terms of cost-effectiveness, we find that CLP-2 is effective, in that the increase in household income substantially outweighs the costs to achieve that increase. However, compared to other livelihood programmes in Bangladesh, CLP-2 is less cost-effective. Part of this can be attributed to the fact that CLP-2 had a sizeable infrastructure development component and is operating in geographically very remote and poor areas.  Sustainability  Our findings on sustainability are based on both quantitative evidence and on qualitative research regarding the perceptions of future sustainability of CLP-2’s impact. There are several key messages with respect to sustainability that result from our research: first, we find no significant CLP-2 Longitudinal Monitoring and Independent Impact Assessment – Final Report – Volume I  e-Pact vii  evidence for a reversal of CLP-induced improvements in the welfare of participant  households. This is a very robust finding across different quantitative and qualitative research methods.  Second, CLP has created resilience to shocks in participant households. We find both quantitative and qualitative evidence that being affected by erosion or floods does affect households, but less so for households that have received the full support of CLP-2 and have been able to build coping strategies.  CLP-2 did not create a situation where households, on average, continuously increased their level of wellbeing. Rather, we find that the largest proportion of CLP-2 attributable gains are achieved at year one after baseline.  Finally, qualitative research points to the introduction of some sustainable practices and behaviour changes among CLP-2 participants. These include VSLs, which have taken root in  many chars and continue to exist beyond CLP support. In addition we find evidence for sustainable agricultural practices among char dwellers that were adopted via knowledge spillovers and marketbased interventions.  Recommendations  We recognise the success of CLP-2 in promoting transformative social and economic change among its participants and their broader communities, which has led to significant gains in graduation and welfare outcomes. At the same time, our qualitative and quantitative analyses point to a number of directions in which the implementation and management of programmes similar to CLP-2 could be further strengthened, and we summarise these in a series of recommendations. In this summary, we present all recommendations related to future livelihood programming. Please refer to the full text for further recommendations on monitoring and evaluation activities of such programs.  1. If working within the context of the chars, assess the effectiveness and relevance of interventions related to erosion and flood protection. Specifically:  a. Consider whether and how plinth construction practices could be further strengthened or modified. b. Review the current practice regarding flood and erosion grants to assess their effectiveness, and explore ways of modifying them.  2. Our research also shows that high dependency ratios posed a structural constraint on the effectiveness of CLP-2. Future livelihood programming may want to take up the task of mitigating the impact of such ratios.  3. Our research shows that the VSL component has proven to be an effective means of promoting productive investment and a vehicle of social change and collective action, especially for women. Future programming should acknowledge the success of VSLs, both in relation to promoting savings and as a vehicle for women’s empowerment, and further strengthen this component.  4. Expanding access to larger affordable loans can further improve households’ ability to invest in productive assets and should be considered. CLP-2 Longitudinal Monitoring and Independent Impact Assessment – Final Report – Volume I  e-Pact viii  5. We recommend that future programming take notice of the tendency of CLP participants to invest in land and consider additional efforts to raise the productivity of agricultural activities.  6. Future programmes should clearly explain the role of vouchers as a temporary discount for veterinary services and not an entitlement to participants. They should further emphasise awareness-raising activities aimed at promoting appreciation of the value of timely veterinary care – preventive as well as curative.  7. The importance of cash savings as a policy objective should be reassessed in future programming.  8. Markets and the local economy should be developed more widely and form part of future core programming. Having access to markets and being equipped to engage with markets in an empowered way was perceived as being of crucial importance for the sustainability of change over time and for ensuring that households continue on an upward development trajectory.  9. The approach to women’s empowerment – including economic empowerment – must be more nuanced, proactive, and grounded in the fact that CLP women tend to feel more empowered in their own communities, where CLP has given them status and support.  10. Building resilience to shocks during the project cycle was one of CLP’s key achievements. Future programming should aim to go further and seek to promote more intensive and continuous growth despite these shocks.  11. A related strategic priority should be reducing the role of remoteness and distance as a factor limiting development in the chars.  12. Similarly, future programmes which operate in the chars could build on recent improvements in the quality and accessibility of money transfer services that can support the flow of resources from employment outside the chars.","2016","2025-10-30 20:05:39","2025-10-19 23:07:27","2025-10-30 20:05:39","","","","","","","Jasper (2016)","","","","Oxford Policy Management Report","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058370      DOI: No DOI","","","","BANGLADESH; Propensity Score Matching (PSM); Chars Livelihood Programme","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121058370","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The self-targeting mechanism used in the Public Work program in Liberia works better since the proportion of poor involved in the program is high. This project has no entry barrier which partly explains the good result. The targeting performance of the Modernization of Agriculture project in the DRC is also poor, most of the beneficiaries being non-poor. The impact in terms of poverty reduction is important in both projects involved in this type of analysis (Modernization of Agriculture in the DRC and Public Work in Liberia), at least for the beneficiaries.

Using a panel dataset of 2099 counties from 2010 to 2020, we construct an industrial classification framework and measure diversification through the equilibrium index. The results indicate that industrial diversification in poverty-stricken counties is significantly lower than that in non-poverty-stricken counties. However, CPAP implementation led to a 2–3% increase in diversification, with stronger effects in deeply poverty-stricken counties and a three-year policy lag. These findings suggest that CPAP can promote regional resilience by shifting development trajectories from path dependence to path creation. This study contributes to evolutionary economic geography by demonstrating how state-led policies can initiate structural transformation in regions with limited endogenous capabilities. It also highlights the importance of policy designs that increase local innovation capacity to sustain industrial diversification.","2025","2025-10-30 20:06:08","2025-10-16 22:32:27","2025-10-30 20:06:08","446-462","","C","87","","","Liu (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121298042","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121298042","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been under implementation for more than 14-years and till continue to undefined periods. Until the time of this study takes place the program passed four phases.The aim of this study is to evaluate the progress and make recommendations. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this study, improvement in the livelihood of rural households is assessed by examining the impact of household participation in the program. Household participation is expected to improve household annual income, smooth different households` consumption and increase the size of livestock holding (TLU), children schooling expense, which are used in this study as indicator of the outcome of the program. Therefore, this study is designed to assess the impact of PSNP on livelihood of rural household (households’ annual income, children schooling expense and size of livestock) in the study area. Findings: The findings from this research help to suggest for policy makers to understanding the role of PSNP and maximize its use by designing strategies of enhancing the productive safety net program. This means that the study helps to know the effect of provision of incentives to enhance physical and productive asset activities. Moreover, the findings of the study help as baseline documents of PSNP impact on particular activities for the future researchers. Practical Implications: The study serve as a bridge for other studies in the future on same and other related issue. It is also essential for community based organizations working in the study area and other areas with similar socioeconomic settings. Originality/Value: To the best of authors’ knowledge, only a few empirical studies have been done so far regarding to impact of PSNP in the Ethiopian context.","2024","2025-10-30 20:06:08","2025-10-30 20:06:40","2025-10-30 20:06:08","31-67","","3","14","","","Yisihak (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121299389","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121299389","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study sheds some light on complementarities between Land Tenure Formalization (LTF) and Productive Social Safety Nets (PSSN) programmes in Tanzania. Using the Tanzania national panel survey data (2020/21 wave), we employed a doubly robust Inverse Probability Weighted Regression Adjustment (IPWRA) to estimate the stand-alone and joint impacts of LTF and PSSN on farm productivity, consumption and food security. We find that joint participation in LTF and PSSN programmes significantly improve farm productivity, households’ consumption and food security. We show that joint impacts of LTF and PSSN are greater than sum of stand-alone impacts suggesting a great complementarity between the programmes. Our cross-tenure analysis suggests a stronger joint impact of statutory LTF with PSSN than that of customary LTF with PSSN, and the true opposite for stand-alone impacts. The study recommends the design of pro-poor productive interventions that incorporate potentially complementary interventions for more optimal outcomes. We suggest for further research on possible interactions between LTF and other anti-poverty interventions for more clarity and sound policy implications.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:08","2025-10-16 22:32:27","2025-10-30 20:06:08","","","","","","","Msangi (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121298927","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121298927","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study also introduces China’s conversion of new and old kinetic energy into this quasi-natural experiment. This study presents the following findings: (1) The new policy for innovative transformation in regional industrial chains and the concept of the conversion of new and old kinetic energy can both significantly promote energy poverty alleviation. (2) The mechanism pathway of “the new policy for innovative transformation in regional industrial chains → the conversion of new and old kinetic energy → the energy poverty alleviation in heating/household electricity/transportation segments” has proved to be an effective practice in China.

Based on microdata derived from the China Family Panel Studies (2010–2022), this study employs the “Broadband China” pilot policy as a quasi-natural experiment to explore how digital economy development influences multidimensional relative poverty. We develop a multidimensional relative poverty index encompassing economic, health, education, and living condition aspects utilizing the Alkire–Foster dual cutoff method and employ a staggered Difference-in-Differences design for empirical analysis. Results show that the policy leads to an average decrease of 1.8 percentage points in the probability of multidimensional relative poverty across households. The effect is more pronounced in central and western regions, rural households, and those with a high proportion of non-labor force, particularly in the dimensions of economic, health, and living conditions dimensions. Mechanism analysis via interaction term regression indicates that increased population mobility and improved informal employment are key channels. These findings suggest that enhancing digital infrastructure and tailoring mobility and employment policies to fit regional and urban–rural contexts can effectively alleviate multidimensional relative poverty. This study contributes empirical evidence connecting the advancement of the digital economy to poverty alleviation and aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty).","2025","2025-10-30 20:06:08","2025-10-30 20:06:40","2025-10-30 20:06:08","1-25","","19","17","","","Ping (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121298501","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121298501","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PSNP contains a mix of public works employment and unconditional transfers. It is a well-targeted program; however, it took several years before payment levels reached intended amounts. As noted elsewhere (Gilligan et al. 2009; Berhane et al. 2015), the PSNP has been successful in improving household food security. In this study, we assess whether it had additional impacts on children's schooling, labor and nutrition. The descriptive analysis we undertook as part of this study, using quantitative data and qualitative fieldwork, shows that there are marked differences in the types of activities children undertake. We saw differences according to both sex and age, with labor demands increasing as children get older. While children in our focus groups make repeated reference to domestic and farm work, there are few references to paid employment outside the home. This is consistent with what we find in the quantitative data. In terms of the impact of the PSNP, there are suggestions of overall positive impacts, but these may differ by age. The implementation of the PSNP restricted our choice of impact evaluation method. We use inverse probability weighting regression adjustment estimators. Although we found some impacts on schooling and child labor, these are not constant over time nor across child sex. In 2008, when PSNP payments were low relative to work requirements, participating in the PSNP lowered grade attainments for both boys and girls and increased child labor on family farms, although for boys, this was offset by reductions in domestic labor. As PSNP payments increased relative to PSNP work requirements - especially in 2012 - these adverse outcomes were reversed. In 2012, the PSNP increased girls' grade attainment between 6 and 14 percent (depending on the age of the child), improved schooling efficiency by 10 to 20 percent and reduced boys' labor. We find no evidence that the PSNP reduces chronic or acute under nutrition. While we cannot definitively say why this occurs, we note that child diet quality is poor. We find no evidence that the PSNP improves child consumption of pulses, oils, fruit, vegetables, dairy or animal source proteins. Most mothers have not had contact with health extension workers, nor have they received information on good feeding practices. Safe water practices - as captured by the likelihood that mothers boil drinking water - are poor.","2017","2025-10-30 20:06:06","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:06","1-63","","","","","","Berhane (2017)","","","","3ie Series Report","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296064      DOI: No DOI","","","","Food Security; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis; Unconditional Cash Transfers; Productive Safety Net Program; Public Works Employment","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296064","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using quantile difference-in-difference, we find that the income gains from program participation is smaller for the lowest two deciles.","2012","2025-10-30 20:06:06","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:06","","","","","","","Emran (2012)","","","","Institute for International Economic Policy Working Paper Series","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296049      DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1354158","","","","Microfinance; food systems and nutrition; Diffeerence-In-Difference; Ultra-Poor; BRAC; Assignment Error; Heteroskedasticity-Based Identification","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296049","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its objective is to improve rural welfare, particularly for groups that have traditionally been excluded for reasons of gender, ethnicity, caste, and location. Since its launch in 2004, the Fund has covered the 40 poorest districts of the country, supported some 15,000 community organizations, and benefited more than 2.5 million people. This paper attempts to estimate the impact of this large-scale program using a randomized phase-in approach, in which certain localities are randomly selected for earlier intervention than others. Using two rounds of survey data and a difference-in-difference combined with instrumental variable estimation method, it finds statistically significant causal impact of the program on key welfare outcomes. The treatment-on-the-treated estimate on real per capita consumption is 19 percent growth. Other impacts include a 19 percentage points decline on incidence of food insecurity (defined as food sufficiency for six months or less) and a 15 percentage points increase in the school enrollment rate among 6-15 year-olds. Impacts (positive or negative) are yet to be detected on indicators associated with child malnutrition, social capital, and empowerment. The policy implications of these results should be of interest to the government and to development partners in determining what may be effective instruments to deliver services to marginalized communities in what remains a fragile and difficult political environment.","2012","2025-10-30 20:06:06","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:06","1-20","","","","","","Parajuli (2012)","","","","World Bank Policy Research Working Paper","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296016      DOI: 10.1596/1813-9450-6042","","","","Nepal; Impact Evaluation; Instrumental Variables; Poverty Alleviation Fund","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296016","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using longitudinal survey data collected in 2006, 2008, and 2010 at the household and locality levels, we employ an extension of the propensity score matching method to continuous treatments to estimate the impact of transfers from the PSNP and a separate program on household food security. Against the formidable background of rising food prices and widespread drought, participation in the Public Works component of the PSNP has modest effects. The PSNP reduced the length of the last hungry season by 1.29 months among households that received transfers for 5 years compared to eligible households that received almost nothing. Five years of participation raises livestock holdings by 0.38 tropical livestock units relative to receipt of payments in only 1 year. There is no evidence that the PSNP crowds out private transfers. The joint impact of access to the PSNP along with a program that helps households to increase agricultural income and build assets is even higher. Having both of these programs reduced the length of the last hungry season by 1.5 months per year and increased livestock holdings by 0.99 tropical livestock units.","2014","2025-10-30 20:06:06","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:06","","","1","63","","","Berhane (2014)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295915","","","","Agricultural Productivity; Targeted Programme; Non-Contributory Transfers; Smooth Assets","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295915","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines how far the public daycare helps in loosening this constraint. To do this, I look at the effect on maternal labor force participation, of daycare implicit in the preschooling provided to young children, through India's largest child development program - Integrated Child De- velopment Scheme (ICDS). Besides preschooling, the ICDS program provides a whole package of other services, including supplementary feeding and immunization. Because of these services, I examine the various pathways through which the benefits on maternal employment can accrue: release of mother's time from child supervision, improvement in health of young children and implicit income subsidy. For the analysis, I primarily use data from the recent demographic health survey data for 2005-6, which for the first time collected information on child level usage of ICDS services. Using probit, covariate matching and conditional logit (village-fixed effects), I find that the mother, whose child is receiving highly correlated services of regular preschooling or daily supplementary feeding, is 12% more likely to work in rural India. This effect is being driven mainly by the rural Central, where such mothers are 25% more likely to work. There is some evidence of positive effect in the rural South also. The inves- tigation of mechanisms provides no support for those related to health benefits of daily supplementary feeding, or its implicit income subsidy. It seems that the effect is being driven mainly by daycare im- plicit in preschooling. There is also some evidence of health benefit mechanism through immunization received at the ICDS center. Further examination suggests lack of support for self-selection by mother into daycare, because the children receiving regular feeding (highly correlated with daycare) are not anthropometrically better, and there is evidence of possible caste based discrimination against children from scheduled castes families in access to preschooling.","2013","2025-10-30 20:06:06","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:06","","","","","","","Jain (2013)","","","","Institute for Research for Labour and Employment, University of California, Los Angeles","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295885      DOI: No DOI","","","","Child Daycare; Labor Force Participation Of Mother","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295885","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The program was led by the TASAF. Its aim was to see if, using a model that relied heavily on communities to target beneficiaries and deliver payments, the program could improve outcomes for the poor the way centrally-run CCT programs have in other contexts. Given scarce resources, TASAF randomly selected 40 villages out of 80 eligible villages in the three study districts to be treated under the pilot program. Communities selected the most vulnerable households to participate before learning which villages were randomly selected to participate in the program. This provided a group of comparison households in the 40 untreated villages. The program provided benefits for poor households based on the number of vulnerable chil- dren (age 0-15) and elderly (age 60+) therein. Payments were made every other month, or six times each year. While CCT payments—which averaged about US $14.50 per month, or about 13 percent of total expenditures—were made at the household level, conditions applied at the in- dividual level. Children aged 0 - 5 were required to visit a health clinic at least six times per year, elderly aged 60 and over were required to visit at least once per year, and no health conditions applied to other individuals. Children aged 7-15 were required to enroll in primary school and maintain an 80 percent attendance record. Locally-elected community management committees monitored compliance with these conditions and penalized participating households that did not comply by docking payments or in extreme cases removing households from the program. A baseline survey was carried out in early 2009. Transfers began in January 2010. A midline survey was carried out in mid-2011 (18-21 months after transfers began). An endline survey was carried out in late 2012 (31-34 months after transfers began). Treatment and comparison households were broadly comparable at baseline, with few significant differences across a wide range of characteristics. In the final analysis, we compared changes over time in treatment and comparison households (a method called difference-in-differences) to adjust for small baseline differences. From these survey data, we found that the pilot program had the following major impacts. 1. After an initial surge in clinic visits among treatment households, 31-34 months into the program (at endline), participating households were attending clinics less often but were healthier: their members were sick 0.4 fewer days per month (averaging across all ages), and children age 0-5 were sick 0.8 fewer days permonth. 2. Health improvements due to the CCT program are even more marked for villages with above- median clinic staff. They experienced almost an entire day per month reduction in sick days (averaging across all ages). 3. In education, the program showed clear positive impacts on whether children had ever at- tended school. Through qualitative data collection exercises, communities reported that the program had dramatic, positive impacts on school attendance. While these positive impacts on absenteeism were not observed in the quantitative data, only 12 percent of children were reported to be absent during the previous week at baseline, so student absenteeism may not be a major problem. Furthermore, the program's conditions only required 80 percent attendance at school. Since attendance records and our baseline survey were collected after conditions were designed, it may have not been clear in advance that they would in many cases be non-binding. In particular, conditions were designed in part given what was considered reasonable attendance, rather than based on past attendance rates. 4. In addition, literacy rates increased significantly for girls 5-18 years old in both follow-up surveys. 5. Some of the most consistent changes observed have to do with health insurance. Treatment households were much more likely to finance medical care with insurance and much more likely to purchase insurance than were their comparison counterparts. This is important because having health insurance can substantially reduce out-of-pocket expenditures for medical care and increase the propensity to seek treatment for healthproblems. 6. Increases in expenditures, either on food or non-food household items, are not significantly higher for treatment households, with the exceptions of insurance and children's shoes. Households, on average, are much more likely to purchase children's shoes. This is es- pecially true for the poorest households. 7. Treated households invested in more livestock assets. Focus groups revealed that house- holds purchased chickens and other animals and used them to create businesses (e.g., selling eggs or chicks) or in order to have easily sellable, productive savings. 8. Because this program relies so heavily on communities — to target, to deliver transfers, and to monitor compliance with conditions — there was concern as to its impact on community cohesion. In fact, treatment households were more likely to express trust in their leaders. 9. On the whole, the community-managed CCT program led to improved outcomes in both health and education. Households used the resources to invest in livestock, in children's shoes, in insurance, and — for the poorest households — in increased savings. This sug- gests that the households focused on reducing risk and on improving their livelihoods rather than principally on increasing consumption. There is also evidence that the project had positive effects on communitycohesion.","2016","2025-10-30 20:06:06","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:06","8-70","","","","","","Evans (2016)","","","","3ie Grantee Final Report","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296067      DOI: 10.23846/tw11001","","","","Nutrition; Health Insurance; Conditional Cash Transfers; Community Run; Literacy Rates","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296067","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) was designed as a large-scale and long-term coordinated effort to fight food insecurity throughout the country. The program, launched in 2005, falls in the 'cash for work' category: poor members of the community can receive small transfers in exchange for working on projects in their community. It is the largest program of its kind in Africa, reaching more than 8 million Ethiopians, about 10 per cent of the population. The dual nature of the PSNP, combining the delivery of safety net protection with the creation of productive assets in the community, means that its impacts are multifaceted, as are the channels through which they operate. At the same time, it has the potential to profoundly affect the agro-ecology of targeted areas. The impacts of the PSNP have been insufficiently studied. Research has focused on the benefits the cash or food transfer has provided to its recipients. We know very little about whether the PSNP has done anything to spark local economic growth, i.e. whether the broader 'productive' goal of the PSNP has met with any success. The PSNP might stimulate growth by loosening investment constraints in beneficiary households, but could also do so through local income multipliers and the creation of public goods (for instance, irrigation, land conservation) that lead to productivity gains, which in turn can create local income multipliers of their own. Past studies have not addressed impacts beyond the beneficiary households. This report is part of an extensive effort to fill this lacuna. We aim to evaluate the impacts of the PSNP beyond the recipients of the cash transfer, both in terms of the local spillovers created by the cash transfer and the impacts of community assets on the local, regional, and national economies. The goal of the project is to apply a comprehensive micro-macro approach to evaluate the full impact of the PSNP. We develop a methodology bridging case studies, econometric evaluations, modeling and simulation approaches to capture the local economic linkages, identify the causal chains in program impacts, and evaluate the full impact of the program at the local and national scales. Case studies allow us to capture context-specific variations in the implementation of PSNP projects on the ground, and a window into the corresponding impact channels. We studied eight kebeles in depth (two in each of four woredas). In each kebele we administered a PSNP-focused community survey and a business survey, and visited the sites of 21 different PSNP projects. Case study analysis suggests that soil and water conservation projects improve agricultural yields and increase availability of water for cattle. Tree projects participate in the conservation of soil and water, while also providing construction materials and business opportunities. Irrigation projects improve yields and allow high-value crops to be grown. To build upon case study insights, we use econometrics to precisely estimate the average size of project impacts and demonstrate causality. We find a 2.8 per cent increase in grain yields that is statistically significant at the .01 level. This impact is interpreted as an average yearly effect in the zones in which a soil and water conservation project was implemented. We also estimate that PSNP irrigation projects lead to 12 per cent growth in vegetable yields on a per-project basis. Yield growth resulting from the PSNP, in turn, can lead to economic growth, a process that we simulate using an economy-wide model. We couple this with simulations of a transfer to eligible households (estimated to be 18 per cent of their income). This provides a simulation estimate of the simultaneous impacts of the productive and safety net components of the PSNP. At the local scale, we use a local economy-wide impact evaluation (LEWIE) model to simulate the PSNP and evaluate its local economy-wide impacts (Taylor and Filipski, 2014). Eight LEWIE models (one for each kebele) reveal substantial local economy-wide impacts of the PSNP, with income and production multipliers of up to 2.4 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) per ETB transferred. Nevertheless, the program multipliers vary considerably across locales, and they can include both positive and negative spillovers for nonrecipient households. Spillover size is determined by the structure of each local economy, the types of activities households engage in, and in particular the degree to which the community is integrated with outside markets. Although the target kebeles are remote, their economies are not completely isolated from the rest of the country. This means that some of the benefits of the PSNP spill out of the kebele and into the rest of the country, for instance through trade, such as when beneficiary households purchase items outside of their kebele. Given the scale of the program, the aggregation of all these spillovers can be large enough to impact national markets. Therefore, we also conduct simulations at the Ethiopia-wide scale. Simulating the PSNP at the national scale with a computable general equilibrium model reveals that the program creates sizeable nationwide spillovers. This reflects the unusual size and scope of the PSNP, the largest program of its kind in Africa. While PSNP areas see the largest income benefits in percentage terms (6 per cent of household income), the rest of the country experiences real income benefits of up to 2 per cent as a result of the PSNP's impacts on supply, demand, wages, and prices. We find that the program increases national value added by 0.99 per cent. This comprehensive approach to evaluating the impacts of the PSNP suggests that the effects of the program beyond the recipient households are far from negligible. Recognizing the broader impacts of the PSNP can change the way we evaluate and think about the economic costs and benefits of the program.","2017","2025-10-30 20:06:06","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:06","1-68","","","","","","Filipski (2017)","","","","3ie Series Report","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296065      DOI: 10.23846/tw11065","","","","Food Security; Food systems and nutrition; Productive Safety Net Program; Agro-Ecology; Community Programs","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296065","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to supporting families in obtaining land, the program administers a farm development grant, assists in the procurement of water infrastructure, provides extension services, and makes sure that beneficiaries obtain group titles to the land. This paper sheds light whether the project had an impact on agricultural production, productivity, and a host of welfare outcomes by measuring differences between beneficiaries and statistically comparable non-beneficiaries, before and after the program. The paper also investigates whether aspects of the program, improved or worsened impacts. Rigorous evaluations are especially important for policy makers given that land reforms require vast financial resources, human resources, and political will. This paper contributes to the very limited body of research on market-based redistributive land reform, particularly in the African context, by evaluating the impact of 27 million dollars land resettlement program in Malawi. Increased access to farmland and cash for farm inputs should increase production, increased extension support is expected to enhance productivity, and formal land title may promote longer-term investments in land. To measure the impact of the program on all variables of interest propensity score matching is used to identify a control group among the ineligible population that is similar to the beneficiaries at baseline, a series of t-tests at baseline helps ensure that the groups are comparable at baseline, qualitative information obtains in-depth information on potential sources of biases that need to be taken care of in the estimations and difference-in difference is used. This analysis indicates that the program had overall positive effects on the landholdings, title-holdings, and agricultural production of participating households. However, there is mixed evidence of the impact of the program on the food security and asset holding.

Furthermore, children growing up in poverty are at risk of experiencing frequent and severe episodes of illness because they are highly exposed to the risk factors associated with catching infectious diseases. Progresa, Mexico's main anti-poverty programme, aims to support and promote parents living in rural areas to invest in children's education, health and nutrition. Poorer unhealthy children in remote rural areas have limited access to health care. This paper investigates whether this rural intervention improved children's health status during its first three years of operation. We examine whether Progresa reduces children's morbidity risks by looking at the changes over time in the incidence of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections. Additionally, we assess whether there are differential treatment effects according to households' severity of poverty. The analyses of this study have been carried out using longitudinal data from a randomized treatment and control survey. Our results indicate that there is some evidence that Progresa contributes to reducing morbidity rates. We find that for both diseases under study, the Programme effect is mainly due to a decrease in the morbidity risks of children aged between 24 and 59 months.

We find that Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction is successfully able to increase the per-capita income, the productive asset bases and the overall food security of its participants in the long run.","2012","2025-10-30 20:06:06","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:06","257-276","","2","4","","","Raza (2012)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296022","","","","Poverty; Bangladesh; Development; Sustainability; food systems and nutrition; Asset Transfer","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121296022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the 1990s, integrated nutrition programs implemented by Save the Children (SC) in Vietnam reduced severe child malnutrition, but it has not been clear if this impact was due primarily to improved diet or reduced disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether a community-based, integrated nutrition program in Vietnam reduced child morbidity due to diarrhea or acute respiratory infections. Children 5 to 25 months old were randomly selected from randomly assigned intervention and comparison communes. Caregivers of children from the intervention and comparison groups (n = 119 per group) were interviewed about their child's morbidity at program baseline and at study months 2, 4, 6, and 12. Multiple logistic regression and general estimating equations (GEE) were used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on the occurrence of any diarrhea and respiratory illness in the preceding two weeks. Respiratory illness, mainly upper respiratory illness, was more common than diarrheal disease at baseline (54% vs. 6%, respectively). During follow-up, children in the intervention communes had approximately half the respiratory illness experienced by those in comparison communes (AOR = 0.5; p = .001). Diarrheal disease was also lower in the intervention group, although differences were not statistically significant. We conclude that SC's integrated nutrition program was associated with reduced upper respiratory illness, perhaps due to improved hygiene practices and/or improved micronutrient intakes.","2002","2025-10-30 20:06:06","2025-10-30 20:06:44","2025-10-30 20:06:06","67-74","","4","23","","","Sripaipan (2002)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295999","","","","Child Mortality; Community-Based Intervention; Infections; Diarrhoea Prevention; Integrated Nutrition Programme","⚠️ Invalid DOI; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295999","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ethiopia’s economy is based on agriculture which contributes about 85% of employment and 45% of the Gross Domestic products (GDP) (source). The level and distribution of poverty in Ethiopia is extensive.

However, since it is prohibitively expensive to provide direct training to all the farmers in SSA, it is critically important to examine the extent to which technologies taught to a small number of farmers disseminate to non-trained farmers. This paper investigates the technology dissemination pathways among smallholder rice producers within a rural irrigation scheme in Tanzania. As an innovative feature, we compare the performance of three cat- egories of farmers: key farmers, who receive intensive pre-season training at a local training center; intermediate farmers, who are trained by the key farmers; and other ordinary farmers. By collecting and analyzing a unique five-year household-level panel data set, we estimate difference-in-differences models to assess how the gap in performance evolve as the technologies spill over from the trained farm- ers to the ordinary farmers. To disentangle the technology spillover process, we also examine the extent to which social and geographical network with the key and intermediate farmers influences the adoption of technologies by the ordinary farmers, by incorporating social relationship variables into spatial econo- metric models. We found that the ordinary farmers who were a relative or residential neighbor of a key or intermediate farmer were more likely to adopt new technologies than those who were not. As a result, while the key farmersâ€™ technology adoption rates rose immediately after the training, those of the non-trained ordinary farmers caught up belatedly. As the technologies disseminated, the paddy yield of the key farmers increased from 3.1 to 5.3 tons per hectare, while the yield of the ordinary farmers increased from 2.6 to 3.7 tons per hectare. Our results suggest the effectiveness and practical potential of farmer-to-farmer extension programs for smallholders in SSA as a cost effective alternative to the con- ventional farmer training approach","2018","2025-10-30 20:06:04","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:04","336-351","","","106","","","Nakano (2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295698","","","","Technology Adoption; Sub-Saharan Africa; food systems and nutrition; Social Learning; Agricultural training; Rice cultivation; Sub-Saharan Africa Tanzania","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295698","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the main goal of cash transfer programs is to reduce poverty, they also have the potential to improve many development outcomes, such as health and education. While many studies, mainly in Latin America and Asia, have investigated the impacts of CTs on poverty and food security and have, for the most part, found positive impacts, less is known about the impacts of CTs in Africa south of the Sahara, and, in particular, West Africa. Moreover, despite the fact that cash transfers have been shown to lead to decreases in poverty, improvements in household food security, and increases in health service utilization, impacts on children's nutritional status (including anthropometric measures) are generally small (Manley, Gitter, and Slavchevska 2013). Consequently, policymakers and governments are left with the question of how to design social safety nets, such as cash transfers, to achieve greater impact on diet quality, health, and nutrition. The overall goal of this research is to generate evidence and knowledge on an integrated program implemented by the Government of Mali that includes a combination of cash transfers and targeted nutrition interventions. The information generated will inform program implementers and policymakers about best options to improve food security and nutrition among vulnerable groups and individuals in West Africa. Specifically, the main objectives of the research are 1. To provide evidence on the contribution of integrated social transfer programs to enhancing household welfare, food security, dietary diversity, and maternal and child nutrition in West Africa. 2. To test different features and combinations of cash transfers with targeted nutrition interventions, and assess their impact on food security and maternal and child nutrition and health outcomes in Mali. 3. To generate knowledge regarding the pathways of impact of these different program packages, identify the most effective and efficient modalities in the context of Mali, and derive lessons learned for other countries in the region. The research entails two study designs: i) a repeated crossâ€sectional survey (baseline, midline and endline) in a sample of 1,440 children between 6 and 24 months of age, mainly to asses the program's impact on child nutrition and health outcomes; ii) a panel study following a cohort of 2,880 children over 3 years mainly focusing on the evaluation of household welfare outcomes. The study will be conducted in the 96 communes where the Jigisemejiri program is being implemented, situated in 5 regions of Mali: Sikasso, Koulikoro, Segou, Mopti and Kayes.","2019","2025-10-30 20:06:04","2025-10-30 20:06:45","2025-10-30 20:06:04","","","Not applicable","Not applicable","","","Gilligan (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295664","","","","Food Security; Malnutrition; food systems and nutrition; Child Nutrition Disorders; cash transfers and; targeted nutrition interventions","⚠️ Invalid DOI; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295664","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"B8TE7SQC","report","2019","Bedoya Guadalupe; Coville Aidan; Haushofer Johannes; Isaqzadeh Mohammad; Shapiro Jeremy","No Household Left Behind: Afghanistan Targeting the Ultra Poor Impact Evaluation","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/10986/31867","The share of people living in extreme poverty fell from 36 percent in 1990 to 10 percent in 2015 but has continued to increase in many fragile and conflict-affected areas where half of the extreme poor are expected to reside by 2030. These areas are also where the least evidence exists on how to tackle poverty. This paper investigates whether the Targeting the Ultra Poor program can lift households out of poverty in a fragile context: Afghanistan. In 80 villages in Balkh province, 1,219 of the poorest households were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Women in treatment households received a one-off “bigpush” package, including a transfer of livestock assets, cash consumption stipend, skills training, and coaching. One year after the program ended—two years after assets were transferred—significant and large impacts are found across all the primary pre-specified outcomes: consumption, assets, psychological well-being, total time spent working, financial inclusion, and women’s empowerment. Per capita consumption increases by 30 percent (USD 24 purchasing power parity, USD 7 nominal per month) with respect to the control group, and the share of households below the national poverty line decreases from 82 percent in the control group to 62 percent in the treatment group. Using modest assumptions about consumption impacts, the intervention has an estimated internal rate of return of 26 percent, excluding non-monetized improvements in psychological well-being, women’s empowerment, and children’s health and education. These findings suggest that “big-push” interventions can dramatically reduce poverty in fragile and conflict-affected regions.","2019","2025-10-30 20:06:04","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:04","","","","","","","Bedoya (2019)","","","","World Bank Policy Research Working Paper","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295641      DOI: No DOI","","","","Poverty; Conflict; Violence; fragility; Big Push; Labor Supply; Women’s empowerment","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295641","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a multidimensional measure of ten indicators, we find that the intervention is successful in reducing the average number of deprivations by the equivalent of half a binary deprivation. Analysis of the adjusted headcount ratio shows that the intervention was successful in reducing multidimensional poverty and disempowerment among those who experience it more severely. However, we find that, x.even at endline, most of the women in the sample experience at least three of the ten deprivations simultaneously. The multidimensional approach to impact evaluation is a demanding requirement on any intervention that aims to reduce poverty as it requires the intervention to simultaneously enhance intended outcomes for every beneficiary. Nevertheless, it can be claimed that these conflict-affected women should not experience any of these deprivations at once.","2017","2025-10-30 20:06:04","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:04","39-9","","","","","","Malaeb (2017)","","","","Other","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295640      DOI: No DOI","","","","Multidimensional Poverty; Women Empowerment; Northern Uganda; Conflict-affected women; Women‘s Income Generating Support Program (WINGS)","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295640","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Setting: The study was conducted in five districts implementing Ghana's LEAP 1000 programme in Northern and Upper East Regions. Participants: Women, from LEAP households, who were pregnant or had a child under 1 year and who participated in baseline and 24-month surveys (2497) participated in the study. Intervention: LEAP provides bimonthly cash payments combined with a premium waiver for enrolment in NHIS to extremely poor households with orphans and vulnerable children, elderly with no productive capacity and persons with severe disability. LEAP 1000, the focus of the current evaluation, expanded eligibility in 2015 to those households with a pregnant woman or child under the age of 12 months. Over the course of the study, households received 13 payments. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Primary outcomes included current and ever enrolment in NHIS. Secondary outcomes include reasons for not enrolling in NHIS. We conducted a mixed-methods impact evaluation using a quasi-experimental design and estimated intent-to- treat impacts on health insurance enrolment among children and adults. Longitudinal qualitative interviews were conducted with an embedded cohort of 20 women and analysed using systematic thematic coding. Results: Current enrolment increased among the treatment group from 37.4% to 46.6% (n=5523) and decreased among the comparison group from 37.3% to 33.3% (n=4804), resulting in programme impacts of 14 (95% CI 7.8 to 20.5) to 15 (95% CI 10.6 to 18.5) percentage points for current NHIS enrolment. Common reasons for not enrolling were fees and travel. Conclusion: While impacts on NHIS enrolment were significant, gaps remain to maximise the potential of integrated programming. NHIS and LEAP could be better streamlined to ensure poor households fully benefit from both services, in a further step towards integrated social protection.","2019","2025-10-30 20:06:04","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:04","e028726-028726","","11","9","","","Palermo (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295557","","","","Unconditional Cash Transfer (UCT); Regression discontinuity design (RDD); Social Health Insurance","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295557","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach combines quantitative research (impact surveys) with qualitative research (stories of change) and gives participants a voice in evaluation, and the opportunity to learn how programmes can be improved and to contribute to public debate on the effectiveness of development cooperation.&nbsp;This impact study of the programme in Somalia was carried out by Oxfam Novib, HIRDA and partners in Somalia in 2013/2014. The study included a broad set of indicators, covering major dimensions of poverty and injustice. Data collected by partners with the help of a smart phone app was transferred into a central data base, managed and analysed by the Oxfam Novib World Citizens Panel team.&nbsp;This report describes the process and presents the major findings of the analysis which include:Impact on livelihoods: Significant differences between target group and control group were found with respect to increased income, increased value of assets and months of sufficient food.Project participation has a positive impact on school enrolment, but still much to do with respect to the quality of education.Child mortality among the target group was significantly lower than among the control group.Surprisingly, for a country like Somalia that continues to be instable and insecure, a large majority of the respondents have mentioned that they had no experience of physical damage due to disasters and neither do they feel a threat. In addition, few people have taken preventive measures regarding possible future disasters. But also few people feel capable to do so. There were no significant differences between the target group and control group on this topic.Access to information and the ability to talk about women’s rights is very limited in Somalia. Violence against women is a problem according to the majority of respondents.Despite many projects on gender and empowerment, talking about sexual and reproductive rights is still a taboo in many communities, both for our target groups and the control groups.The programme carried out a total of 6000 interviews: the major activities of respondents were sustainable livelihoods (27%), education (17%), humanitarian aid (12%), and women’s rights (12%).&nbsp;","2015","2025-10-30 20:06:04","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:04","","","","","","","Huisman (2015)","","","","Other","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295774      DOI: No DOI","","","","Food Security; Disasters; Sustainable Livelihoods; Somalia; Gender Based Violence","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295774","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested whether a structural and norms-based intervention, which worked with adolescent girls, their families, communities, and secondary schools to address poverty, schooling quality and gender norms, could reduce secondary school drop-out and child marriage among scheduled-caste/scheduled-tribe (SC/ ST) adolescent girls in rural settings of southern India.Methods 80 of 121 villages in Vijayapura and Bagalkote districts, Karnataka State, were randomly selected (control=40; intervention=40). All 12- 13 year-old SC/ST girls in final year of primary school (standard 7th) were enrolled and followed for 3 years (2014-2017) until the end of secondary school (standard 10th). Primary trial outcomes were proportion of girls whocompleted secondary school and were married, by trial end-line (15-16 years). Analyses were intention-to-treat and used individual-level girl data.Results 92.6% (2275/2457) girls at baseline and 72.8% (1788/2457) at end-line were interviewed. At end-line, one-fourth had not completed secondary school (control=24.9%; intervention=25.4%), and one in ten reported being married (control=9.6%; intervention=10.1%). These were lower than expected based on district-level data available before the trial, with no difference between these, or other schooling or sexual and reproductive outcomes, by trial arm. There was a small but significant increase in secondary school entry (adjusted odds ratio AOR=3.58, 95% confidence interval CI=1.36-9.44) and completion (AOR=1.54, 95%CI=1.02-2.34)in Vijayapura district. The sensitivity and attrition analyses did not impact the overall result indicating that attrition of girls at end-line was random without much bearing on overall result.Conclusions Samata intervention had no overall impact, however, it added value in one of the two implementation districts- increasing secondary school entry and completion. Lower than expected school drop-out and child marriage rates at end-line reflect strong secular changes, likely due to large-scale government initiatives to keep girls in school and delay marriage. Although government programmes may be sufficient to reach most girls in these settings, a substantial proportion of SC/ST girls remain atrisk of early marriage and school drop-out, and require targeted programming. Addressing multiple forms of clustered disadvantage among hardest to reach will be key to ensuring India “leaves no-one behind” and achieves its gender, health and education Sustainable Development Goal aspirations","2019","2025-10-30 20:06:04","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:04","","","1","9","","","Prakash (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295763","","","","Secondary Education; Adolescent Girls; Child Marriage","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295763","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper assessed the progress of IMNCI in India, identified the programme bottlenecks, and also assessed the effect on coverage of key newborn and childcare practices. Programme data were analyzed to ascertain the implementation status; rapid programme assessment was conducted for identifying the programme bottlenecks; and results of analysis of two rounds of district-level household surveys were used for comparing the change in the coverage of child-health interventions in IMNCI and control districts.

The Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP) is a widespread conditional cash transfer programme, launched in 2003, which transfers cash to poor households (maximum income US$70 per person a month) when they comply with conditions related to health and education. Transfers range from $18 to $175 per month, depending on the income and composition of the family. We aimed to assess the eff ect of the BFP on deaths of children younger than 5 years (under-5), overall and resulting from specifi c causes associated with poverty: malnutrition, diarrhoea, and lower respiratory infections. Methods The study had a mixed ecological design. It covered the period from 2004–09 and included 2853 (of 5565) municipalities with death and livebirth statistics of adequate quality. We used government sources to calculate allcause under-5 mortality rates and under-5 mortality rates for selected causes. BFP coverage was classifi ed as low (0·0–17·1%), intermediate (17·2–32·0%), high (>32·0%), or consolidated (>32·0% and target population coverage ≥100% for at least 4 years). We did multivariable regression analyses of panel data with fixed-eff ects negative binomial models, adjusted for relevant social and economic covariates, and for the eff ect of the largest primary health-care scheme in the country (Family Health Programme). Findings Under-5 mortality rate, overall and resulting from poverty-related causes, decreased as BFP coverage increased. The rate ratios (RR) for the effect of the BFP on overall under-5 mortality rate were 0·94 (95% CI 0·92–0·96) for intermediate coverage, 0·88 (0·85–0·91) for high coverage, and 0·83 (0·79–0·88) for consolidated coverage. The effect of consolidated BFP coverage was highest on under-5 mortality resulting from malnutrition (RR 0·35; 95% CI 0·24–0·50) and diarrhoea (0·47; 0·37–0·61). Interpretation A conditional cash transfer programme can greatly contribute to a decrease in childhood mortality overall, and in particular for deaths attributable to poverty-related causes such as malnutrition and diarrhoea, in a large middle-income country such as Brazil.

Objective: We assessed the effect of zinc supplementation on growth and morbidity in poor Bangladeshi infants aged 4-24 wk. Design: Infants from Dhaka slums were enrolled at 4 wk of age and randomly assigned to receive 5 mg elemental Zn/d (n = 152) or placebo (n = 149) until 24 wk of age. They were followed weekly for information on compliance and morbidity; anthropometric measurements were performed monthly. Serum zinc was assessed at baseline and at 24 wk of age. Results: At 24 wk of age, serum zinc concentrations were higher in the zinc than in the placebo group (13.3 +/- 3.8 and 10.7 +/- 2.9 micro mol/L, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Significantly greater weight gains were observed in the zinc than in the placebo group for 43 infants who were zinc deficient (&lt; 9.18 micro mol/L) at baseline (3.15 +/- 0.77 and 2.66 +/- 0.80 kg, respectively; P &lt; 0.04). In the other infants, no significant differences were observed in mean weight and length gains during the study period.

This study aims to evaluate the achievements of the Saemaul Zero Hunger Communities Project (SZHCP) of the World Food Program (WFP) implemented by Good Neighbors International (GNI) in partnership with Tanzanian and Bangladesh local governments, which ran from 2014 to 2018 in selected local communi- ties in Tanzania and Bangladesh. The project targeted the most vulnerable communities to improve their livelihood and rural development programs in terms of food security, income generation, education, and infrastructure improvement through community-based activities. To collect information and data for evaluation, we conducted field research such as in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and house- hold surveys in the target villages of the SZHCP in Tanzania and Bangladesh. Using qualitative analysis, difference-in-difference estimation, and linear regression on surveys of 1142 respondents, we show that the SZHCP significantly improved the livelihoods of beneficiaries in relation to zero hunger, and also increased income generation and promoted positive social changes. It has also helped to strengthen the capacity of communities to run development projects themselves. This study provides evidence- based analysis that could allow stakeholders and researchers to more fully engage with future community-based projects.","2019","2025-10-30 20:06:04","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:04","","","","124","","","Kim (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295638","","","","HUNGER; World Food Programme; Zero hunger; SUSTAINABLE development; RURAL development; COMMUNITY-based social services; Community-based projects; Good Neighbors International","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295638","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While positive socioeconomic effects and spill-over effects are well-documented, this is the first paper to evaluate the effects of the programme on nutritional outcomes of under-5 children using data from a randomized control trial over a four-year period. We find notable improvements in nutritional outcomes of children in participating households. TUP is further seen to improve food-security, sanitation and duration of exclusive-breastfeeding. Nutrition status of children living in poor non-participant households are also positively affected though no effects were found on children from non-poor households.

HARVEST project interventions focused on increasing incomes to influence nutrition outcomes. This was achieved through an approach that integrated activities from a range of sectors (agriculture, fisheries, forestry, nutrition and more) to help families in rural areas grow, purchase, and prepare more nutritious foods. Over that time, the project's strategy evolved as activities were scaled up, but the overall approach remained guided by the principles of linking agriculture and nutrition to achieve some of the overarching development goals of reducing poverty and malnutrition. To assess whether this approach of linking agriculture and nutrition through a comprehensive development project such as Cambodia HARVEST is effective, an independent and rigorous impact evaluation of Cambodia HARVEST was conducted. Baseline and endline data were collected in 2012 and 2016, respectively. This report presents the results of the endline survey conducted in HARVEST targeted villages to assess whether and by how much project outcome status of some key FTF indicators along the impact pathway improved for Cambodia HARVEST clients compared with the baseline. It also presents the results of the impact evaluation of project interventions using rigorous methodologies that take into account counterfactuals and selection bias issues to assess whether the observed changes in outcome status of client households can be attributed to Cambodia HARVEST. The main findings of this study are that, on all counts of productivity, crop income, expenditures, poverty, hunger, dietary diversity and indicators of malnutrition, Cambodia HARVEST client households saw a significant improvement from the levels observed in 2012 (baseline) to 2016 (endline). The non-project beneficiaries also saw similar levels of improvements, however, perhaps due to the presence of other donor and government programmes or because of spillover effects of Cambodia HARVEST due to the close proximity of treatment and comparison villages. Impact analysis thus failed to detect any statistically significant programme effect on the treated or intended to treat households. Because of these confounding factors (i.e., presence of other donors and government programmes in the study area, and potential contamination from close proximity of treatment and comparison villages) this study cannot arrive at any conclusions about the relative effectiveness of Cambodia HARVEST, other donor programmes, or no interventions.","2017","2025-10-30 20:06:01","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:01","","","","","","","Maredia (2017)","","","","Michigan State University, Department of Agricultural Economics","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295556      DOI: No DOI","","","","Cambodia; malnutrition; Ecosystem stability; Food Insecurity; Food Nutrition; Rural vulnerabilities","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295556","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Government of China responded with a number of major environmental programs, the most expensive and influential of which, the Grain for Green (GfG) Program, was implemented widely from 1999. Under the GfG Program - also known as the Sloping Land Conversion or Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program - the central government compensates farmers to convert cropland on steep slopes or otherwise ecologically sensitive areas to forest or grassland. Its long-term success depends on households' ability to make sustainable changes to their household income streams and income diversification strategies. In this paper, we use a difference-in-difference estimation approach to examine the role of migration as a household-level response to the GfG Program, testing the extent to which individuals migrate following a reduction in land available for farming. Importantly, we exploit 15 years of data on migration decisions and establish that participating and non-participating households were on parallel migration paths before the program, thus refuting a key threat to causality in a difference-in-difference model. We find that participating families do, in fact, choose migration as an income diversification strategy more frequently than non-participants. The program effects varied over time but peaked post-Great Recession in 2011 when migration rates in GfG households exceeded those of non-GfG households by 5.9% points (p=0.003) or about 26%. Our findings should encourage policymakers that families are making long-term adjustments to their livelihood strategies to avoid poverty in anticipation of the eventual withdrawal of government supports.","2018","2025-10-30 20:06:01","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:01","489-499","","3","62","","","Treacy (2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295549","","","","Developing Countries; Natural Disasters; APEC countries; EE950; Asia; EE115; Natural Resource Economics; East Asia; People's Republic of China; EE900; jobs; PP600; Water Resources; basins; Income and Poverty; Pollution and Degradation; PP200; catchment areas; Labour and Employment; Forests and Forest Trees (Biology and Ecology); KK100; farmland; Biological Resources (General); Ecology (General); PP700; ZZ330; Yellow River; Grasslands and Rangelands; PP350; PP800","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295549","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used household data from 529 villagers in China’s Whole Village Poverty Alleviation Program. We focused on two types of program participation—discussion and voting. Using the propensity score matching approach, we estimate the impact of rural households’ program participation on their income. The results show that the education and the political career of the household head determine program participation. Households participating in discussion and voting have a positive and significant effect on household income. Richer households benefit more from the program. However, the poor receive less benefits.

While there is extensive evidence that shows the prevalence of child labour is low among beneficiaries of conditional cash transfer programmes, the impact of workfare programs on child labour has been rarely investigated in the economics literature. This paper addresses the issue by evaluating the impact of the public works component of the Productive Safety Net Programme implemented in Ethiopia in 2005. The programme aims to help poor households to build assets and develop resilience to shocks through employment in public projects. Results from child fixed effects estimations show that children in programme beneficiary households are significantly less likely than their counterparts in non-beneficiary households to be involved in child labour. The findings suggest that, if well targeted, even safety net programmes that do not primarily target child outcomes can be useful in addressing child labour problems.","2019","2025-10-30 20:06:01","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:01","283-301","","3","87","","","Dinku (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295516","","","","Ethiopia; children; Safety Net; Child Labour; Public works programme","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295516","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We described the evolution of EED biomarkers from birth to 18 months in rural Zimbabwe and tested the independent and combined effects of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF), on EED. Methodology and findings: The Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial was a 2x2 factorial cluster-randomised trial of improved IYCF and improved WASH on child stunting and anaemia at 18 months of age. 1169 infants born to HIV-negative mothers provided plasma and faecal specimens at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months of age. We measured EED biomarkers that reflect all domains of the hypothesized pathological pathway. Markers of intestinal permeability and intestinal inflammation declined over time, while markers of microbial translocation and systemic inflammation increased between 1–18 months. Markers of intestinal damage (I-FABP) and repair (REG-1β) mirrored each other, and citrulline (a marker of intestinal epithelial mass) increased from 6 months of age, suggesting dynamic epithelial turnover and regeneration in response to enteric insults. We observed few effects of IYCF and WASH on EED after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The WASH intervention decreased plasma IGF-1 at 3 months (β:0.89, 95%CI:0.81,0.98) and plasma kynurenine at 12 months (β: 0.92, 95%CI:0.87,0.97), and increased plasma IGF-1 at 18 months (β:1.15, 95%CI:1.05,1.25), but these small WASH effects did not translate into improved growth. Conclusions: Overall, we observed dynamic trends in EED but few effects of IYCF or WASH on biomarkers during the first 18 months after birth, suggesting that these interventions did not impact EED. Transformative WASH interventions are required to prevent or ameliorate EED in low-income settings. Author summary: Child stunting remains a global health challenge rooted in an intergenerational cycle of poor health, reduced neurodevelopment and poverty. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is an acquired condition of the small intestine likely resulting from frequent faecal-oral microbial exposure, which is hypothesized to underlie stunting. We found dynamic changes in EED biomarkers between 1 and 18 months of age in a cohort of rural Zimbabwean infants, suggesting a complex developmental period of intestinal maturation, adaptation and response to environmental insults. Randomized improved infant and young child feeding, and improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions had no meaningful impact on EED. Greater investment in transformative WASH is needed to prevent EED in low-income countries.

The study used latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 2010 and have applied PSM approach to analyse the impacts. The study has chosen 4286 households to include in probit model as control group from the households other than the treated group of 446 households. Propensity scores ranged from approximately zero to one with a mean of 0.102. Various indicators such as labor allocation, income generating activities, investment and shock`s coping strategies etc. were chosen to identify the productive outcomes. The ATE on the treated was significant for income generating activities (farm and non-farm), labor allocation (farm and non-farm, self-employment) and investment (agricultural assets, inputs). The farm activities increased by 0.40 units but non-farm activities declined by 0.73 units per household due to agriculture rehabilitation program. One of the areas of reduction of labor unit is day laborer in non-farm sector - moved from non-farm to on-farm activities. The results suggest that ARP is a promising means of safety net for the marginal and small farmers in Bangladesh. This type of safety net could contribute more to productive outcomes.

In this article, the productivity impact of the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS) input subsidy support program implemented was examined in 2011. The study employs a two-stage probability design to collect household survey data from 390 households in Kano State. As an analytical approach, the study employed a propensity score matching and a Two-Stage Least Square (2SLS) regression estimator that corrects for selectivity and endogeneity problems respectively while Hedges ""g"" was used to estimate the effect size of GESS. Maize yield and total factor productivity index were used as indicators to estimate the productivity impact of GESS program. The result from two-stage least square estimator showed that GESS subsidy increased the yield of participants by 32.3% and the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) while the result of total factor productivity index, (showed that the participants were more productive) and had an average of 14.1% net gain from the cost incurred in production in the 2016 farming season. The size of the estimated treatment effect suggests an improvement in the productivity outcomes of participants. The study found that the results of the study are consistent with similar findings and therefore validate the hypothesis that the GESS subsidy programme improved the productivity of beneficiary households. The scheme obviously has enormous potentials and is also very promising for agricultural input procurement and distribution to resource-poor households in Nigeria. In addition, there is a need for capacity building of the farmers by local extension agents in the form of integrated crop management practices in order to sustain productivity gains. This study concludes that input use alone is not enough to increase maize production, improvement in input use efficiency through integrated crop management practices are also needed.","2020","2025-10-30 20:06:01","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:01","90-101","","1","15","","","Tiri (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295536","","","","Developing Countries; Africa; Africa South of Sahara; Agricultural Economics; angiosperms; commelinids; Commonwealth of Nations; corn; EE110; EE130; eukaryotes; monocotyledons; plants; Poaceae; Poales; Spermatophyta; subsaharan Africa; Supply; Zea; Zea mays; ACP Countries; Anglophone Africa; West Africa; EE800; EE900; Investment; EE145; FF005; FF100; Field Crops; Input Utilization (Microeconomics); Plant Production; jobs; DD100; Finance and Credit; Demand and Prices; Labour and Employment; Agencies and Organizations","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295536","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social protection especially cash transfer is increasingly recognized as an important strategy to accelerate progress in improving maternal and child nutrition. A critical method to improve nutrition knowledge and influence feeding practices is through behaviour change communication intervention. The Shonjibon Cash and Counselling study aims to assess the effectiveness of unconditional cash transfers combined with a mobile application on nutrition counselling and direct counselling through mobile phone in reducing the prevalence of stunting in children at 18 months.Method: The study is a longitudinal cluster randomised controlled trial, with two parallel groups, and cluster assignment by groups of villages. The cohort of mother-child dyads will be followed-up over the intervention period of approximately 24 months, starting from recruitment to 18 months of the child's age. The study will take place in north-central Bangladesh. The primary trial outcome will be the percentage of stunted children at 18 m as measured in follow up assessments starting from birth. The secondary trial outcomes will include differences between treatment arms in (1) Mean birthweight, percentage with low birthweight and small for gestational age (2) Mean child length-for age, weight for age and weight-for-length Z scores (3) Prevalence of child wasting (4) Percentage of women exclusively breastfeeding and mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding (5) Percentage of children consuming &gt; 4 food groups (6) Mean child intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate, fat and micronutrients (7) Percentage of women at risk of inadequate nutrient intakes in all three trimesters (8) Maternal weight gain (9) Household food security (10) Number of events for child suffering from diarrhoea, acute respiratory illness and fever (11) Average costs of mobile phone BCC and cash transfer, and benefit-cost ratio for primary and secondary outcomes.Discussion: The proposed trial will provide high-level evidence of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of mobile phone nutrition behavior change communication, combined with unconditional cash transfers in reducing child undernutrition in rural Bangladesh.Trial Registration: The study has been registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN12618001975280 ).

Despite their role in economic growth and the received investment, irrigation schemes are still underperforming. Among many irrigation schemes, transferring more management responsibilities to farmers proved to be a viable path toward improving performance. However, the large diversity of implementation strategies makes evaluation difficult, while its well-demonstrated benefits have paramount importance to convince reluctant smallholders to take additional roles. In order to address this gap, we analyze the effects of participation on farming outcomes (yield, revenue, net profit) by estimating the treatment effect. We present the case study of a Mubuku small-scale irrigation scheme, Uganda. We provide a framework to construct the Farmers Participation Index while distinguishing farmers into participating and not participating groups. The effects of participation are investigated through econometric methods including nonparametric and semiparametric estimation methods such as a difference in means, a regression adjustment, propensity score matching, and entropy balancing. The analysis reveals a positive and significant treatment effect of participation on farming outcomes. The obtained results endorse the efforts of governmental programs to foster responsibility transfer and the farmers' role in irrigation management. A strong causal relationship between management and profitability provides incentives for farmers to engage in participation.","2019","2025-10-30 20:06:01","2025-10-16 20:44:37","2025-10-30 20:06:01","","","11","11","","","Pék (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295487","","","","Developing Countries; Africa; Africa South of Sahara; Commonwealth of Nations; EE130; Least Developed Countries; Supply; ACP Countries; Anglophone Africa; East Africa; JJ800; Water Resources; Demand and Prices; PP200; Soil Water Management (Irrigation and Drainage); Techniques and Methodology; ZZ900","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295487","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The role of aspirations in facilitating movement out of poverty is a subject of increasing research in development economics. Previous work finds positive impacts from international child sponsorship on educational attainment, employment, and adult income. This paper seeks to ascertain whether the impacts of child sponsorship on educational outcomes may occur through elevated aspirations among sponsored children. Using an age-eligibility rule applied during program rollout to identify causal effects, we study whether international child sponsorship increases educational and vocational aspirations among a sample of 2022 children in Kenya, Indonesia, and Mexico. While effects are heterogeneous, and strongest in Kenya, we find that, averaging over the three countries, sponsorship increased indices of self-esteem (0.25sd), optimism (0.26sd), aspirations (0.29sd), and expected years of completed education (0.43 years). We find that sponsorship increases actual grade completion by 0.56 among children at the time of the survey, and mediation analysis suggests that the impact of sponsorship on aspirations is likely to mediate higher levels of grade completion. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating that the positive impacts of child sponsorship stem partly through elevating aspirations. More generally, our research contributes to a larger literature suggesting that the alleviation of internal constraints among the poor is a strong complement to addressing their external constraints.

As a result, the government needs to know the outcome of the program intervention for further decisions in similar poverty reduction strategies. This study examined the impact of Productive Safety Net Program intervention on food security of rural households in rural western Ethiopia. A cross-sectional survey data were gathered from a total of randomly selected 188 beneficiary and non-beneficiary sample households. Key informants interviews and focus group discussions were employed to triangulate household survey results. A Chi-square test was employed to compare the households' food security status. The propensity score matching method was used to evaluate the impact of a Productive safety net on beneficiary households' food security status. In this study, the Productive Safety net program has significantly increased households' calorie intake. The beneficiaries' households were more food secure than non-beneficiary households by 68% and54% respectively. The mean energy available for the beneficiary and non-beneficiary households is 2488.500 and 2153.394 kcal, respectively. Estimates of the average treatment effect of the treated indicated that a Productive safety net program can impact households food security by 2519.29348 kilocalories, higher in the kernel matching method. This is an encouraging indicator for Programme implementers and funding agents. Therefore, channeling further efforts on this indicator is important for a more pronounced impact of the Programme. Given a certain level of variations of different program impact studies, this study recommends further research with greater scope and at different locations on the impact of PSNP and related Food Security Programs on households' food security status.","2022","2025-10-30 20:06:01","2025-10-30 20:06:51","2025-10-30 20:06:01","","","1","17","","","Getachew (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295429","","","","Propensity Score Matching (PSM); Food Insecurity; Western Ethiopia; Productive Safety Net Program","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121295429","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study applied random effects with instrumental variable to estimate the effect of PSNP membership. The result of the study indicates that though PSNP membership improves household food consumption, it reduces household dietary diversity score. Household food consumption and dietary diversity are also significantly influenced by sex, age, education status of household head, household size, livestock ownership, distance to the nearest market and participation in non-farm activities. The findings of this study suggest that PSNP membership should be reinforced by building household awareness of the benefits of consuming a variety of foods.

While some studies found positive impacts on food security and agricultural productivity, there are still gaps in understanding the long-term effects of these programs on poverty reduction and food security. This study aims to investigate the impact of PSNP on the livelihood of beneficiaries based on indicators including access to basic services, income, expenditure on food, adaptive capacity, and dietary diversity. Methodology: This article used quasi-experimental design and treatment effects model taking into account access to basic services, income, food expenditure, assets, adaptive capacity, and household dietary diversity as outcome variables of interest. 300 respondents were randomly selected from the population of safety net beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries in the study area. Out of the 300 respondents, 150 were selected as the treatment group, who were beneficiaries of the safety net program. The algorithms used in analysis include regression adjustment, inverse probability weighing and propensity score matching. Results: The study's results reveal that the PSNP has no statistically significant impact on access to basic services and income based on all three algorithms, yet it does show a significant and negative effect on food expenditure and assets. The coefficients across all three models consistently demonstrate this negative impact, underscoring its statistical significance at the conventional significance level (p = 0.05). This suggests that the PSNP leads to a reduction in food expenditure. Furthermore, the analysis highlights substantial differences between PSNP members and non-members across all three variables, with non-members having higher mean values for assets. This difference is statistically significant at the 1% level, suggesting that membership in the PSNP has a tangible impact on asset ownership. The study's mixed findings emphasize the complexities of designing effective social protection programs that can adequately address the multifaceted nature of poverty.","2024","2025-10-30 20:06:13","2025-10-30 20:07:12","2025-10-30 20:06:13","","","4","19","","","Woldemichael (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121317634","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121317634","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis usespanel data for 4,250 households from two rounds of a survey conducted in 2004 and 2008 in five districts. Propensity score matching was used to construct control groups and outcomes are compared with differences-in-differences. There are two major impacts. First, the Indira Kranti Patham program increased participants' access to loans, which allowed them to accumulate some assets (livestock and durables for the poorest and nonfarm assets for the poor), invest in education, and increase total expenditures (for the poorest and poor). Women who participated in the program had more freedom to go places and were less afraid to disagree with their husbands; the women participated more in village meetings and their children were slightly more likely to attend school. Consistent with the emphasis of the program on the poor, the impacts were stronger across the board for the poorest and poor participants and were more pronounced for long-term Scheduled Tribe participants. No significant differences are found between participants and nonparticipants in some maternal and child health indicators. Second, program participants were significantly more likely to benefit from various targeted government programs, most important the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, but also midday meals in schools, hostels, and housing programs. This was an important way in which the program contributed to the improved wellbeing of program participants. The effects captured by the analysis accrue to program participants over and above those that may accrue to all households in program villages.","2014","2025-10-30 20:06:13","2025-10-30 20:07:13","2025-10-30 20:06:13","33-pp","","6841","","","","Prennushi (2014)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121316992","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121316992","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It first develops a simple theoretical model where child labor and training are chosen to maximize inter-temporal household income, given constraints to social, household, and child endowments. Then, it conducts an empirical analysis using the randomized trial data collected to evaluate the 2006 Nicaragua conditional cash transfer (CCT) program. This social program transferred wealth to poor families in rural areas of the country conditional on children's school attendance and health check-ups. One-third of the beneficiaries received, in addition, a wealth transfer to begin a non-agricultural business. The paper finds that the CCT program had a selective impact on the volume and quality of child labor, reducing it in the aggregate and steering it toward skill-forming activities. Specifically, the program appears to have reduced child labor for household chores and traditional farming while increasing it for non-traditional activities related to commerce and retail. These require the child to develop basic skills in reading and writing, arithmetic, and interpersonal relationships. Moreover, the paper finds that the source behind the increase in the better-quality type of child labor is not the basic component of the program but distinctively its business-grant intervention.","2016","2025-10-30 20:06:13","2025-10-30 20:07:15","2025-10-30 20:06:13","33-47","","","80","","","Carpio (2016)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121315117","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121315117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigates factors that led to the effects of the New Hope Project, a work-based, anti-poverty program directed at parents on youths' career-related thoughts and planning. The New Hope project was implemented in Milwaukee, WI, during the mid-1990s. 745 families participated (52% male children; 56% African American; 30 % Latino, and 15% White non-Hispanic) and half were randomly selected to receive New Hope benefits, which included earnings supplements, job search assistance, and child and health care subsidies for 3 years. Importantly, effects on youths' future orientation were found 8 years after the program began (5 years after benefits ended). The present study investigates what factors sustained these positive impacts over time. Results indicate that parental perceptions of reading performance mediate the effects of New Hope on youths' cynicism about work. Additionally, parental perceptions of reading performance and youths' educational expectations mediate the effects of New Hope on boys' pessimism about future employment. These findings highlight the importance of youths' educational development to their career-related thoughts and planning.

They have eroded the livelihoods of vulnerable populations, making it difficult to meet their food needs. This deterioration may be linked to declining agricultural production and inadequate incomes. To remedy this situation, a project to rehabilitate the productive means of agro-pastoralist populations was implemented by FAO from 2013 to 2014 and tested the ""Cash +"" approach, linking a monetary transfer and the distribution of productive inputs, compared to a traditional input distribution (input approach) with kits of the same value for the breeding of poultry (traditional chickens) or goats. The project provided four kits (kit ""Cash + goats"", kit ""goats"", kit ""Cash + chicken"" and kit ""chicken""), to 2,000 poor and very poor households in 8 communes (Kaya, Barsalogo, Pissila, Mane, Namissiguima, Pibaore, Korsimoro and Dablo), from the Province of Sanmatenga, Central North Region. To evaluate the impact of the interventions, 3 socio-economic studies were carried out one year apart during the project. In the second year of the project, poultry raising provided better remuneration than goat raising, but it also allowed a strong growth in the value of the herd and consequently an improvement in household resilience. ""Very poor"" households with very modest incomes in the first year managed to improve their income more than the ""poor"". The ""Very poor"" generally appear to benefit more sensibly from the gains of the kits received than the ""Poor"" ones, even for durable goods (plows, carts, bicycles), which shows well the relevance of these aids for the most deprived.","2017","2025-10-30 20:06:13","2025-10-30 20:07:17","2025-10-30 20:06:13","Article-89","","5","29","","","Sawadogo (2017)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121314185","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121314185","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The government of Bangladesh has launched an incentive programme for small and marginal farmers with an attempt to rejuvenate Aus rice cultivation. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of government input support on Aus rice production in Bangladesh and its impact on food security and farmers' poverty situation. A total of 120 (i.e., 60 supported and 60 non-supported) farmers from two upazilas of Mymensingh district were selected. Data were analysed with a combination of descriptive statistics, mathematical and statistical techniques. Results: The results show that rice cultivation occupied the major portion of farmers' total cropped area. The government of Bangladesh had provided with input (both cash and kind) support in order to boost Aus rice (UFSHI and NERICA variety) production. Cropping intensity of supported farmers' was increased by 39.7%, whereas it was increased by only 1.4% for non-supported farmers. Productivity of Aus rice was 138.0 and 100.0% in stare of supported and non-supported farmers, respectively. Average per capita daily calorie intake of the households was still below the national average level of 2122 kcal. Poverty in terms of deprivation of health education, employment, housing, mobility and income was decreased, and overall livelihood circumstances were improved through government input support on Aus rice production. Conclusion: The study concludes that the motivation provided with by the government through input support on Aus rice production was highly appreciated by the farmers. Though per capita daily calorie intake by the farmers was still under the national average level, supported farmers were more food secure than non-supported farmers. Several dimensions of poverty were decreased, and overall socioeconomic status was improved. The study recommended that scientific and technical training programmes should be arranged to raise farmers' awareness about Aus rice production for enhancing their livelihood.","2018","2025-10-30 20:06:13","2025-10-30 20:07:18","2025-10-30 20:06:13","","","14","7","","","Uddin (2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121313436","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121313436","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Families were randomly selected to receive New Hope benefits, which included earnings supplements, job search assistance, and child and health care subsidies. Benefits were available for three years. Importantly, effects on youths' future orientation were found eight years after the program began (five years after benefits ended). The present study investigates what factors sustained these positive impacts over time. Specifically, earlier effects (measured two years after benefits ended) on parental employment and income, youths' participation in center-based care and structured activities, youths' academic skills, youths' social behaviors, and youths' educational expectations are hypothesized to mediate the effects of New Hope on employment and future orientation. Program effects on employment and future orientation were concentrated among boys and African American youth. This study also examines how mediating factors may have contributed to the gender and ethnic differences found in program impacts. Results indicate that parent perceptions of reading performance mediate the effects of New Hope on duration of employment, cynicism about work, and pessimism about future employment. Results of subgroups analyses reveal that gender differences in impacts on employment and future orientation are primarily accounted for by the small impacts of New Hope on girls' academic skills at earlier time points. Results of ethnic subgroups are inconclusive due to unequal sample sizes across groups. Implications for policy and future research are discussed.

More specifically, the study tested (1) whether participation in a subsidized matched savings program had an independent effect above and beyond the effect of individual and family characteristics on adolescents' saving attitudes and self-reported financial asset accumulation; (2) whether family characteristics (i.e. family relations, family financial socialization, and household demographics) moderated the effect of participation in a subsidized matched child savings program on adolescents' saving attitudes and self-reported financial asset accumulation; and (3) whether the adolescents' future orientation and family financial socialization served as mechanisms to transmit the effect of the participation in a subsidized matched child savings program on adolescents' self-reported financial asset accumulation. Grounded in an integrated theoretical framework of classical and behavioral economics, family financial socialization theory, and the institutional theory of saving, this study used longitudinal analyses of data on 346 dyads (adolescents and their guardians) collected in a experimental cluster-randomized controlled trial. The study found that adolescents' saving attitudes (both reported willingness to save and reported confidence in saving), although not affected by participation in a subsidized matched child savings program, were significantly associated with family relations, family financial socialization, caregiver's gender, and adolescent's gender and educational aspirations. Adolescents' self-reported saving was significantly affected by participation in a subsidized matched child savings program; this effect was direct, and neither moderated nor mediated by any of the family characteristics, nor by adolescent's future orientation. The adolescents' self-reported amount saved is significantly affected by participation in a subsidized matched child savings program. This effect is weakened by the number of children in the household: the more children in the household, the weaker the effect. In addition, the effect is potentially mediated by the guardian saving for the adolescent. The findings contribute to the institutional perspective on saving arguing that saving is not only a function of individual characteristics, but also institutional opportunities. Findings may help inform programs and policies facilitating asset-building initiatives for youth in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

But no significant effect is found regarding the probability for the rural poor to be active in business or rural-urban migration. Moreover, under the poverty alleviation programs, household incomes from agricultural cultivation, livestock breeding and total household income have increased significantly while wage income has decreased. Meanwhile, no significant effect is found regarding business income and per capita household income. The results show that industrial poverty alleviation strategies have brought good effects to increase poor households' income and expand their livelihood generating activities regarding agricultural cultivation and livestock breeding.

In this body of research I explore how under-appreciated economic and psychological phenomena can cause policies to have indirect or unexpected consequences. In Chapter 1 I investigate whether interventions that promote healthy behaviors can generate negative spillovers on other behaviors due to limited attention. In an online experiment in which individuals receive combinations of messages and incentives for two healthy behaviors, I find that interventions do indeed have negative effects on non-targeted behaviors. I argue that these spillovers can be attributed to a distinct kind of limited attention with distinct policy implications. In Chapter 2, my co-authors and I unpack the impacts of an intensive, multi-faceted intervention that aimed to improve the lives of the ultra-poor in Ghana. We find that key components of the multi-faceted intervention---an asset transfer and savings collection---do not generate the same large impacts when implemented separately. Our results suggest that there are key complementarities between inputs, as well as important returns to coaching, that can be leveraged when designing programs for the ultra-poor. In Chapter 3, my co-authors and I examine the income effects of the same interventions on labor supply, taking advantage of a bag-making employment program that was experimentally implemented among the same beneficiaries in Ghana. We find that beneficiaries of the multi-faceted program, relative to non-beneficiaries, provided more hours and more effort per hour. We argue that frictions in labor and capital markets are not sufficient to interpret the pattern of responses to variations in wealth, cash transfers, wage, tasks, and access to savings.

Building on an IPV-specific intervention (Intervention for Health Enhancement After Leaving [iHEAL]), ""Reclaiming Our Spirits"" (ROS) is a health promotion intervention developed to address this gap. Offered over 6 to 8 months in a partnership between nurses and Indigenous Elders, nurses worked individually with women focusing on six areas for health promotion and integrated health-related workshops within weekly Circles led by an Indigenous Elder. The efficacy of ROS in improving women's quality of life and health was examined in a community sample of 152 Indigenous women living in highly marginalizing conditions in two Canadian cities. Participants completed standard self-report measures of primary (quality of life, trauma symptoms) and secondary outcomes (depressive symptoms, social support, mastery, personal agency, interpersonal agency, chronic pain disability) at three points: preintervention (T1), postintervention (T2), and 6 months later (T3). In an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to examine hypothesized changes in outcomes over time. As hypothesized, women's quality of life and trauma symptoms improved significantly pre- to postintervention and these changes were maintained 6 months later. Similar patterns of improvement were noted for five of six secondary outcomes, although improvements in interpersonal agency were not maintained at T3. Chronic pain disability did not change over time. Within a context of extreme poverty, structural violence, and high levels of trauma and substance use, some women enrolled but were unable to participate. Despite the challenging circumstances in the women's lives, these findings suggest that this intervention has promise and can be effectively tailored to the specific needs of Indigenous women.

The first chapter evaluates whether a financial policy to improve bank density in underserved areas in India benefited micro and small enterprises. The branch expansion policy targeted districts classified as underbanked, based on their ex-ante branch density, making the policy intervention suitable for a regression discontinuity design. Using a large nationally representative survey on informal MSEs located in districts within a narrow window around the threshold, this paper shows that enterprises in districts classified as underbanked witnessed large increases in revenue, gross value-addition, and productive capital in the aftermath of the reform. There was no change in credit access (from the bank and non-bank sources) for MSEs in underbanked districts. Our analyses reveal potential spill-over from industry linkages with formal enterprises. The second chapter applies recently developed ML methods to characterize the microentrepreneurs from extremely poor households who benefit (and who do not) from their participation in the Ultra-poor Graduation (UPG) model - a popular poverty alleviation program. Though previous studies have shown a large degree of heterogeneity in the treatment effect of the UPG model, the question of why some households benefit while others do not remains unanswered - mostly due to the limitations of conventional econometric models that do not allow using a rich set of baseline variables for treatment effect heterogeneity investigation. Applying recently developed machine learning methods on a large-scale RCT dataset from Bangladesh, this chapter address this problem and characterizes the UPG program participants who benefit and who do not. The results indicate a trade-off between wealth and consumption gains: some beneficiaries focused on accumulating assets while others increased their consumption. When profiling the top gainers on these two outcomes, the analyses show opposing characteristics between these two groups. The characteristics of the top gainers identified in this research can be used for improved targeting to maximize the impact of the UPG program on the desired dimension. Alternatively, the characteristics of those who failed to benefit can be used to customize the program interventions for balancing the asset and consumption trade-off. Finally, the third chapter, through a randomized control trial (RCT) setup, tested the individual and joint impacts of two types of messaging on the willingness to pay for fortified rice among low-income Bangladeshi consumers. The first type of messaging anchored the rice with a well-known high-value aspirational product. The second type established the credibility of its health benefits by connecting it to a well-known public distribution program. Drawing on insights from the marketing and consumer behavior literature, we argue that messages which position a product as aspirational or establish the credibility of its health benefits can increase consumer demand for the product. Indeed, the measured impact on WTP when both messages were combined was sufficiently large to elicit a price premium for fortified rice that would cover the cost of fortification. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting new evidence on the role of information in stimulating demand for a credence good.

Parental loss to AIDS has orphaned millions, exacerbating economic and psychosocial challenges. Economic empowerment interventions (EEIs) promote asset accumulation and financial stability, but the role of depression in moderating their effectiveness remains underexplored. This study examines the impact of an EEI on economic security among HIV/AIDS-orphaned adolescents in Southern Uganda, exploring depression as a moderator. Data from 1383 HIV-orphaned adolescents (10-16 years) were collected from 48 primary schools in Masaka, Uganda (2011-2016), under the Bridges to the Future study. Mixed-effects regression models assessed EEI impact on economic security, measured through physical assets (20-item index) and financial assets (savings yes/no). Depression (Child Depression Inventory) was included as a moderator. Participants' mean age was 12.68 years. The intervention significantly increased financial (chi2(8) = 32.79, p < 0.001) and physical assets (chi2(8) = 23.18, p = 0.003). Depression moderated both physical (chi2(12) = 52.89, p < 0.001) and financial asset accumulation (chi2(8) = 23.60, p = 0.023). Gender differences were also observed: the intervention positively impacted physical assets for females (chi2(8) = 38.41, p < 0.001) but not males (chi2(8) = 3.41, p = 0.906), while financial assets improved significantly for males (chi2(8) = 18.89, p = 0.015) but not females (chi2(8) = 13.33, p = 0.101). The EEI enhanced economic security among HIV/AIDS-orphaned adolescents, with gender-specific effects. Additionally, depression moderated asset accumulation, highlighting the need to integrate mental health support and adopt gender-sensitive approaches in EEIs to promote sustainable economic security.

In a community-randomised trial, we implemented 2 home-based interventions, each serving as an attention control for the other. One group received an integrated household intervention package (IHIP), whereas the other group received an early child development (ECD) intervention. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of IHIP on diarrhoea and respiratory infections, the details of which are described elsewhere. Here, we present the impact of the ECD intervention on early childhood development indicators. Methods: In this non-blinded community-randomised trial, an ECD intervention, adapted from the Peruvian government's National Wawa Wasi ECD programme, was implemented in 25 rural Peruvian Andean communities. We enrolled 534 children aged 6-35 months, from 50 communities randomised 1:1 into ECD and IHIP communities. In ECD communities, trained fieldworkers instructed mothers every 3 weeks over the 12 months study, to stimulate and interact with their children and to use standard programme toys. IHIP communities received an improved stove and hygiene promotion. Using a nationally validated ECD evaluation instrument, all children were assessed at baseline and 12 months later for overall performance on age-specific developmental milestones which fall into 7 developmental domains. Findings: At baseline, ECD-group and IHIP-group children performed similarly in all domains. After 12 months, data from 258 ECD-group and 251 IHIP-group children could be analysed. The proportion of children scoring above the mean in their specific age group was significantly higher in the ECD group in all domains (range: 12-23%-points higher than IHIP group). We observed the biggest difference in fine motor skills (62% vs 39% scores above the mean, OR: 2.6, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.9). Conclusions: The home-based ECD intervention effectively improved child development overall across domains and separately by investigated domain.

LMI taxpayer refunds typically may consist of overwitheld amounts from wages, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and the refundable Additional Child Tax Credit. Previous research has shown inconsistent results on the enhanced asset-building effectiveness of providing LMI earners with (i) a lump-sum tax subsidy versus smaller amounts distributed more frequently, and (ii) financial information. With varying specifics, the six research questions ask how federal income taxation and consumer credit impact LMI asset building, including any effect of the FCU at tax preparation. This study adds to the literature by illuminating the barriers to asset building that LMI taxpayers face from these institutional systems and the impact of personalized financial information delivered at tax preparation. A goal of this research is to identify possible policy paths to asset development among LMI earners. The framework utilized behavioral economics of mental accounting, institutional asset building, financial capability, and asset accumulation theories. Regression analyses tested relationships between variables pertaining to LMI taxpayer credit card debt, tax refund uses, and the implementation of financial recommendations. These variables were derived using survey, credit, and tax return data from 119 LMI taxpayers in Boston. Three questions were addressed qualitatively using data from in-depth interviews with 17 LMI taxpayers. The results of the quantitative analyses show positive associations between (i) LMI taxpayers with dependents and debt, and the use of larger refunds for paying consumer debt, but also some use for specific asset-building purposes; (ii) tax overwithholding and higher consumer debt, but also refund allocation to savings; (iii) the elapse of a year between FCU and following an FCU recommendation; and (iv) FCU influence on debt payment and credit score. The qualitative findings show that low earnings and lack of assets contribute to keeping the LMI taxpayer in a precarious financial position. Receiving financial guidance at tax preparation can be useful but is insufficient to counter the structural barriers to asset building.

Analyses were informed by two sources of data including juvenile charge and adjudication data from five states and crime report data from the national Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. We limited analyses to cases involving children and youth ages 10-17. We applied a two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences model to compare trends in outcomes within states before and after Medicaid expansion was implemented in 2014 and between states that did and did not expand Medicaid. Analyses informed by the state-level juvenile justice data indicated that Medicaid expansion was associated with significant decreases in rates of first-time robbery, 22%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [1, 38], and assault charges (19%, 95% CI = [0, 34]), and with first-time robbery (24%, 95% CI = [3, 41]) and assault adjudications (19%, 95% CI = [1, 34]). There was no policy association with sexual offending. Analyses informed by Uniform Crime Reporting data did not indicate an association between Medicaid expansion and any type of violent offense reports. We cautiously concluded that Medicaid expansion may be associated with reductions in youth robbery and assault, possibly as a result of an antipoverty pathway.

The purpose of the programme is to modernize rural Viet Nam. Given the universal implementation of the programme, we use a quasi-experimental approach whereby we employ three evaluation techniques which each have their own strengths and weaknesses: an income growth model (ordinary least squares), differences-in-differences, and propensity score matching. We exploit the fact that not all rural communes graduated by the end of the period as 'new rural communes' and consider the unsuccessful communes as our comparison group. We find that the programme was responsible for an increase in household income of between 16 and 28 per cent, depending on the evaluation method used. As the comparison communes have also benefited to some extent from the programme, these percentages are an underestimate of the true effect. We also find that the programme was pro-poor and that it raised non-farm income in particular.","2018","2025-10-30 20:06:11","2025-10-30 20:07:26","2025-10-30 20:06:11","20-pp","","164","","","","Verwimp (2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121308867","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121308867","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the top priorities, solving a broadening income and poverty gap between urban and rural areas, between leading and lagging regions, and among ethnic groups are one of the most essential issues. This research paper is targeted to provide an empirical evidence for answering the question whether the government assistance could effectively and positively impact on rural households' income through the NRD program by using a Hierarchical Linear Modelling (HLM). The results of the mixed effect model could firmly reveal that the financial assistance could positively influence on rural households' income through investments in roads, income generation models, and technical trainings.","2018","2025-10-30 20:06:11","2025-10-30 20:07:27","2025-10-30 20:06:11","3-15","","4","10","","","Manh (2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121308827","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121308827","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The program provided a conditional cash and land transfer to poor families to relocate to larger plots of farm land. The average treatment effect of the program is estimated using a difference-in-difference matching technique based on propensity score matching; qualitative information complement the analysis to ensure unobservable characteristics do not bias the findings. As expected, the results show a significant effect on landholdings and agricultural production, with land size increasing and maize production increasing by more than 100 kilograms relative to the control. However, the impacts on food security and asset holdings were mixed. Households that relocated great distances had systematically lower impacts than those households that stayed within their district of origin because they had to adapt to unfamiliar agro-ecological, cultural, and market environments. Impacts also varied across gender of the household head; female-headed beneficiary households increased their productive and consumption assets significantly, while male-headed households increased their asset holdings less so.","2009","2025-10-30 20:06:11","2025-10-16 22:38:53","2025-10-30 20:06:11","","","","","","","Datar (2009)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121308106","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121308106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the impact of the SLCP on household income is a subject of much research. This study was conducted to determine whether the SLCP has affected incomes of households at different income levels 13 years after its implementation. Using survey data from 2012 on rural households' livelihoods in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River in Sichuan Province and using the non-participating households as a reference, the current impact of the SLCP on household income is calculated with a multiple linear regression model and a quantile regression model. The socio-geographic features of participating and non-participating households are also be compared. The results show no significant differences between the SLCP participating and non-participating households in many socio-demographic characteristics. Participating in the SLCP had no significant impact on household income at all income levels in the study area in 2012. This finding suggests that the SLCP is not currently increasing household income significantly in the study area, and that the implementation plan of the SLCP should be changed in this area in order to achieve its poverty reduction goal.","2018","2025-10-30 20:06:11","2025-10-30 20:07:27","2025-10-30 20:06:11","516-525","","5","9","","","Huang (2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121307820","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121307820","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its objective is to improve rural welfare, particularly for groups that have traditionally been excluded for reasons of gender, ethnicity, caste, and location. Since its launch in 2004, the Fund has covered the 40 poorest districts of the country, supported some 15,000 community organizations, and benefited more than 2.5 million people. This paper attempts to estimate the impact of this large-scale program using a randomized phase-in approach, in which certain localities are randomly selected for earlier intervention than others. Using two rounds of survey data and a difference-in-difference combined with instrumental variable estimation method, it finds statistically significant causal impact of the program on key welfare outcomes. The treatment-on-the-treated estimate on real per capita consumption is 19 percent growth. Other impacts include a 19 percentage points decline on incidence of food insecurity (defined as food sufficiency for six months or less) and a 15 percentage points increase in the school enrollment rate among 6-15 year-olds. Impacts (positive or negative) are yet to be detected on indicators associated with child malnutrition, social capital, and empowerment. The policy implications of these results should be of interest to the government and to development partners in determining what may be effective instruments to deliver services to marginalized communities in what remains a fragile and difficult political environment.","2012","2025-10-30 20:06:11","2025-10-16 22:38:53","2025-10-30 20:06:11","","","","","","","Parajuli (2012)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121307275","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121307275","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We avoid such selection problems with a quasi-experimental design exploiting an exogenous bureaucratic failure. We find the program resulted in a 20 to 35 percentage point reduction in poverty incidence among ex-combatants and moderate improvement in livelihoods.

The purpose of this study is to ascertain the extent to which the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) has improved welfare and reduced poverty in the Wa West District of Ghana. Arguing through the lens of the rights-based theoretical perspective, the study employed the difference-in-difference analytical technique to compare the extent to which poverty in the district has been lessened among beneficiaries of the LEAP programme against non-beneficiaries. The results show that the LEAP programme had a positive impact on food security as LEAP beneficiaries were more satisfied with their food consumption as compared to non-beneficiaries. Also there was a significant difference between the percentages of LEAP beneficiaries enrolled onto the NHIS as compared to non-beneficiaries. On the effect of the LEAP programme on access to credit, the study reveals that there exists a significant difference between the beneficiary group and non-beneficiary group and that access to credit amongst the beneficiary group is significantly higher than the non-beneficiary group. The study finds no statistically significant relationship between the LEAP beneficiary group and the non-beneficiary group in terms of productive activities.

We randomly gave cash and in-kind grants to male- and female-owned microenterprises in urban Ghana. Our findings cast doubt on the ability of capital alone to stimulate the growth of female microenterprises. First, while the average treatment effects of the in-kind grants are large and positive for both males and females, the gain in profits is almost zero for women with initial profits below the median, suggesting that capital alone is not enough to grow subsistence enterprises owned by women. Second, for women we strongly reject equality of the cash and in-kind grants; only in-kind grants lead to growth in business profits. The results for men also suggest a lower impact of cash, but differences between cash and in-kind grants are less robust. The difference in the effects of cash and in-kind grants is associated more with a lack of self-control than with external pressure. As a result, the manner in which funding is provided affects microenterprise growth.","2011","2025-10-30 20:06:44","2025-10-20 11:14:54","2025-10-30 20:06:44","","","","","","","Fafchamps (2011)","","","","CEPR Discussion Papers","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121430615","","","","ghana; O12; Microenterprises; C93; conditionality; asset integration; O16","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121430615","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8466","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lack of access to finance is a frequent complaint of microenterprises, which account for a large share of employment in developing countries. However, assessing the extent to which a lack of capital affects their business profits is complicated by the fact that business investment is likely to be correlated with a host of unmeasured characteristics of the owner and firm, such as entrepreneurial ability and demand shocks. In a randomized experiment that gave cash and in-kind grants to small retail firms, providing an exogenous shock to capital, the shock generated large increases in profits, with the effects concentrated among firms that were more financially constrained.

As part of the RFSA, AVSI was tasked with adapting a graduation program to improve food security, nutrition, self-reliance, and resilience among extremely poor refugee and host households in Rwamwanja Refugee Settlement and in the surrounding host community of Kamwenge District. The Graduation Approach is a multifaceted model combining livelihood promotion, financial inclusion, social empowerment, and social protection components. It is designed to address the needs of extremely poor households and to equip recipients with protection processes, such as sustainable livelihoods, improved savings, and household dynamics, by building skills and confidence. The initiative seeks to ensure households are able to meet their basic needs, as well as build an asset base to diversify income, protect themselves from shocks, and sustain wellbeing. The approach typically consists of six components:1 The type of numbered list used may depend on the type of document, but default to: 1. Consumption support: to stabilize incomes and enable households to focus on skills training to build or expand livelihoods, as well as prevent consumption of productive assets. 2. Productive asset transfer: in-kind (for instance, livestock) or cash that can be for any smallscale income-generating activity. 3. Technical training: covering improved agronomic and animal husbandry technical skills, financial literacy, enterprise selection planning and management, climate risk management, and bank linkages. 4. Coaching: the relationship between a coach and participant consisting of regular visits and support sessions (generally weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) over a 30-month period to support households set realistic goals, monitor households’ progress, reinforce lessons, help solve problems as they arise, and link/refer participants to needed services. 5. Access to savings: to create a secure place to save resources and access financial capital to grow businesses and meet household current and future needs. 6. Referrals and linkages to critical services: this can include basic information on sanitation and nutrition, nutrition referral and management, public and private sector linkages like extension services, group registration, financial services, and access to inputs. Together with a consortium including Trickle Up and IMPAQ International, 2 AVSI adapted the six graduation components to the context of Kamwenge. The activity they designed was named Graduating to Resilience. Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) was selected to evaluate the 1 See a description of the six components of the Graduation Approach: https://www.avsi.org/en/news/2019/01/10/g2r-activity-update-2-graduation-approach/1729/ 2 Now called the American Institutes for Research Endline Report of the RFSA Graduating to Resilience in Uganda, Cohort 1 Executive Summary vii activity using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to measure the impact and cost-effectiveness of different variations of graduation programming for refugees and host communities. The study was designed to test the relative performance and cost-effectiveness of three activity variations. Households in treatment arm “T1” were coached individually and received a cash asset transfer. Households in treatment arm “T2” were coached in groups and received a cash asset transfer. Households in treatment arm “T3” were coached individually but did not receive a cash asset transfer. Both T2 and T3 were variations chosen to identify lower-cost, more costeffective versions of the standard version, which is T1. To estimate the impact of each of the three intervention arms, households were compared to a control group in control villages (“Pure Control”). Furthermore, some households in treatment villages were randomized into a “Spillover Control” group. These households were not offered participation in any of the interventions. Since other households in the same villages were participating in the activity, this allows a comparison of “Spillover Control” households to “Pure Control” households to measure the aggregate spillovers from the three treatment arms to other households in the same villages. Table 1. Activity components by treatment arm Activity Component T1: Standard Graduation T2: Group Coaching T3: Empowerment Model Consumption support* ● ● ● Livelihood skills training and support ● ● ● Savings and financial inclusion ● ● ● Cash asset Transfer ($300) ● ● Coaching Individual Group Individual Linkages and referrals ● ● ● *$4 (host) / $5 (refugee) per household member per month for 12 months Between August 2018 and November 2018, IPA conducted a baseline survey to assess the status of key indicators3 among participating households, gain a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the study population, and guide the randomization of households into the three intervention variations and control groups. Approximately 30 months later, between April and October 2021, IPA conducted an endline survey. The goal was to collect information on study households to assess the impact of the activity 18 months after the end of the monthly cash consumption support and 24 months after the asset cash transfer. 3 Baseline key indicators included indicators on assets, income, consumption, food security, well-being, and anthropometric measurements. TOPS Uganda Graduation RCT Associate Award Executive Summary viii Coaching sessions ended during the endline data collection in June 2021. The endline survey measured household consumption, food security, asset ownership, income, subjective wellbeing, and other outcomes to compare against baseline results. The target sample was composed of 11,145 households that were interviewed during the baseline survey and randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms, the Spillover Control group or the Pure Control group. During endline data collection, IPA enumerators were able to complete interviews for 94% of the sample (10,514 households), with completion rates balanced across experimental groups. The main findings on key outcomes of interest are as follows: • There was a large positive impact of the activity on several key outcomes. T1 (individual coaching and asset) and T2 (group coaching and asset) have the largest impact, but T3 (individual coaching and no asset) still has a large impact on the different outcomes. No major differences were observed between those who received individual versus group coaching (T1 and T2). • The average value of productive assets was between purchasing power parity (PPP) $819 (T3) and PPP $1,105 (T1) among households assigned to the treatment groups, which is larger than the average of PPP $585 among households in the Pure Control group. • The average monthly income for households assigned to the treatment groups was between PPP $124 (T3) and PPP $136 (T1), which is larger than the average PPP of $94 among households in the Pure Control group. • The average monthly consumption per capita of the households assigned to the treatment groups was between PPP $111 (T3) and PPP $118 (T1), which is larger than the average PPP of $94 among households in the Pure Control group. • Food security also increased among all treatment groups, with households scoring on average 0.51 (T3) to 0.63 (T1) standard deviations (SD) higher on a composite food security index than Pure Control households (for which the mean was normalized to zero). The index includes the Food Consumption Score (FCS), the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), and the households’ average length/height-for-age z-score (HAZ) for children under 5 years. The increase in the index was driven by the increase in the FCS and HFIAS. The percentage of households deemed as “Acceptable” according to the FCS was between 92% (T3) and 94% (T1) among households assigned to the treatment groups, compared to households assigned to the Pure Control group, for which this value was 87%. The percentage of households deemed as “Food Secure” according to the HFIAS was between 29% (T3) and 38% (T1) among households assigned to the treatment groups, compared to households assigned to the Pure Control group, for which this value was 12%. There was no difference between treatment and control groups in terms of HAZ for children under 5. • Target participants’ subjective well-being increased in households assigned to the treatment groups, which had an average that was between 0.44 (T3) to 0.62 (T1) SDs higher on a composite well-being index than Pure Control households (among which the mean was normalized to zero). The index includes the Kessler 6 mental health scale (from 0 to 24; higher = worse) and a life satisfaction question (on an increasing scale from 1 to 10). The average Kessler 6 score in households assigned to the treatment groups was between 5.3 (T3) and 4.8 (T1), compared to households assigned to the Pure Control group, which averaged 5.9. The average life satisfaction score of households assigned to the treatment groups was between 4.6 (T3) and 5.0 (T1), compared to households assigned to the Pure Control group, which averaged 3.4. • There were sizable—albeit less precisely estimated—spillover effects of the activity on consumption levels and food security of households who were eligible but not assigned to treatment and who resided in treatment villages. Spillover magnitudes are between 25% (as a share of T1’s treatment effect estimate) and 36% (as a share of T3's treatment effect estimate) of the direct treatment effects for consumption and 13% (as a share of T1's treatment effect estimate) to 16% (as a share of T3's treatment effect estimate) for a composite food security index. There was no sign of sizable spillover effects on measures of economic activity, such as productive assets and income, suggesting that spillovers on consumption and food security may be operating via informal community insurance against shocks rather than a broader effect on aggregate economic activity in the intervention villages. • Treatment effects are larger for hosts than for refugees (especially for asset holdings), except for consumption, where the effects are similar for the two sample populations. The effect on livestock holdings is larger in the host sample in absolute terms but higher in the refugee sample relative to the respective Pure Control means. Before the intervention, hosts were slightly better off than refugees, owning more productive assets and larger land. The results from the endline survey demonstrate that households assigned to treatment groups fared better than households assigned to the Pure Control group in key economic outcomes, such as accumulation of productive assets, income, consumption, food security, and subjective well-being. Individual and group coaching have similar impact results. Households assigned to the asset transfer arms (T1 and T2) were better off than households assigned to the no-asset arm (T3). The group coaching arm (T2) has similar impacts to T1 in each of these metrics, but 13% lower costs and therefore performs best in the cost-benefit analysis. T3 (no asset) performs worse than T1 and T2 and has a negative return on investment under reasonable assumptions about the persistence of effects. Based on these findings, the group-coaching version of the activity appears to be the “best buy” among the Graduating to Resilience implementation approaches.","","2025-10-30 20:06:44","2025-10-20 11:14:54","2025-10-30 20:06:44","","","","","","","Endline Report of the...","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121430610","","C:\Users\LucasSempe\Zotero\storage\47P3KIZ4\Final+Uganda+G2R+Cohort+1+Endline.pdf","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121430610","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

IFPRI conducted an experimental, quantitative impact evaluation of SPIR designed to measure the causal impact of multisectoral “graduation model” packages of interventions for improving outcomes in several domains, including livelihoods, food security, child nutrition, women’s empowerment, mental health, and intimate partner violence (IPV).

The SPIR-II aims to enhance livelihoods, increase resilience to shocks, and improve food security and nutrition for rural households vulnerable to food insecurity in Ethiopia. The IMPEL SPIR-II impact evaluation employs an experimental design with multiple treatment arms, comparing combinations of livelihood and nutrition graduation model programming provided to the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) beneficiaries relative to a control group receiving only PSNP transfers. The design includes 234 kebeles assigned to three treatment arms. In the first arm (the control group), PSNP is implemented by the government with SPIR II support for the provision of cash and food transfers only. In the second arm, SPIR II programming is rolled out to PSNP beneficiary households in conjunction with nurturing care groups targeting enhanced infant and young child nutritional practices. In the third arm, PSNP beneficiary households receive SPIR II programming and NCGs, supplemented with additional targeted cash grants. Specifically, it includes data collected from the baseline survey of the RCT conducted in August September 2022, which entailed interviews with both the primary female respondent (pregnant or lactating woman) and her spouse. The sample for the baseline survey comprises 3,015 households in 234 kebeles from 15 woredas in the Amhara and Oromia regions. The inclusion criteria required that households were PSNP beneficiaries reporting the presence of an infant under nine months of age (along with his/her mother or primary caretaker) or a pregnant woman. The realized sample corresponds to 98% of the target sample; three kebeles were excluded from the sample due to insecurity or other challenges that rendered it impossible to conduct surveys.","2025","2025-10-30 20:06:44","2025-10-30 20:07:42","2025-10-30 20:06:44","","","","","","","Institute (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121378508","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121378508","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This project is delivered as part of a multifaceted graduation model social protection program, SPIR II (Strengthen Productive Safety Net Program Institutions and Resilience II) that seeks to further sustain nutrition security and reduce risks to livelihoods for households participating in the Ethiopia’s national safety program, the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), which provides consumption support in the form of cash and food transfers. The goal of the SLM innovation being tested is to leverage social protection to promote women’s engagement in sustainable land management practices. Strengthening women’s involvement in sustainable land management is seen as potentially important given that extreme weather events pose risks for poor households in rural Ethiopia and women may be disproportionately at risk from these shocks. For example, Kato et al (2021) find that plots controlled by women in Ethiopia are more prone to soil erosion and of poorer quality in terms of soil depth, and women’s participation in watershed committees is low. The sustainable land management practices being introduced may help protect women and their families from these shocks over the longer term as well as introduce an additional livelihoods avenue. The innovation tested includes providing training (to either women only or to both men and women from same households) and free inputs (tree seedlings, vegetable seeds and tools for home gardening) among participants of the PSNP public works program, thus helping to address constraints to accessing information and inputs, and assessing whether spousal cooperation is important for successful adoption of these technologies.","2024","2025-10-30 20:06:44","2025-10-17 17:44:01","2025-10-30 20:06:44","","","","","","","Gilligan (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121378507","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121378507","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study used a primary data of 820 farm households to examine the relationship between membership of water user association (WUA) and food security, using a quasi-experimental research design. The findings show that WUA membership is significantly influenced by factors including age, marital status, access to extension services, participation in supplementary irrigation (SI) and drought index insurance (DII) initiatives, farm size, and an asset aspiration gap. The results further indicate a positive association between WUA participation and household food security.

The Act guarantees 100 days of assured man-days employment in a nancial year to any rural household whose adult members are willing to do unskilled manual work. But due to administrative the performance of MGNREGAat national as well as at state level is very poor. The present study on evaluation of the MGNREGA scheme is intended to assess the performance & impact of this scheme on the overall quality of life of people by assessing different parameters associated with the scheme. The study was carried out in two community development blocks of district Pulwama, viz. block Shadimarg and block Newa. The tools employed on the data for obtaining logical results were descriptive statistics like averages, percentages, t-test, logit regression analysis and propensity score matching. The results of the study reveal less participation of weaker sections in sampled district. The percentage share of SCs, STs and Women stands 0.02 per cent, 4.34 per cent & 29.56 per cent respectively. The study further reveals that block wise nancial and physical performance under MGNREGA depicts that the expenditure percentage has improved with the increase in wage rates. Due to better irrigation availability, 77.8 per cent of respondents in block Shadimarg and 80 per cent in block Newa recorded that MGNREGAhas positive impact on the increase in agriculture production and productivity. To conclude, the scheme demands a re-orientation so that it can generate productive assets in the economy. It needs a strong planning and some additional features that can enable it to perform well as a scheme to contribute towards the shift of the economy towards full employment path.","2020","2025-10-30 20:06:40","2025-10-30 20:07:47","2025-10-30 20:06:40","69-81","","2","45","","","Wani (2020)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121363273","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121363273","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although both programs operate in several districts with some overlaps, evidence is scarce on how these large-scale programs jointly affect the food security of vulnerable groups. This study examines the impacts of a combination of these programs on food security outcomes among female-headed households in a chronically food-insecure and drought-prone district. Cross-sectional data were collected from 365 female-headed households selected through multi-stage sampling technique and analyzed using Inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) strategy to assess the effect of the programs on food security. The results show that while 63.6% of sample households are enrolled in CBHI and 48.8% are beneficiaries of PSNP's conditional cash transfer (CCT) component, membership in both social protection programs was 38.9%. The IPWRA analysis finds that inclusion in the CCT combined with CBHI, on average, increased dietary diversity score by 0.918 (95% CI 0.779-1.057) and food consumption score by 0.576 (95% CI 0.464-0.688). It also reduced household food insecurity access scale by 8.658 (95% CI -9.775 - -7.541). In all assessments, a combination of CBHI and CCT always produced results of a larger magnitude than each of CBHI and CCT alone. The findings provide evidence of the potentials of integrating social protection programs to increase food security outcomes among the most vulnerable and marginalized groups in a developing country. In addition, the results have also useful implications to achieve sustainable development goals related to ending hunger and achieving food security among vulnerable groups.","2024","2025-10-30 20:06:40","2025-10-30 20:07:47","2025-10-30 20:06:40","","","2","19","","","Mussa (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121363218","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121363218","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines differences in the impact of the Lesotho Child Grant Programme (CGP) on food security, health, education and livelihoods between people with and without disabilities using data from a community randomized control trial. Overall, this study finds the CGP had significant and differential impacts for people with disabilities across multiple health indicators (e.g. increased health expenditures, self-rated health, likelihood of seeking healthcare). The CGP also had an impact on food security, decreasing the number of months households with and without members with disabilities faced extreme food shortages. There was also a modest but significant and differential impact of the CGP on the engagement of people with disabilities in paid work. The CGP only had an impact on school enrolment for children without disabilities, however the difference in impact was non-significant and likely due to underpowered sample sizes. Overall, people with disabilities receiving the CGP still experienced high levels of absolute deprivation, and were generally still worse off compared to people without disabilities, indicating a need for adapted or complementary social protection and other poverty alleviation programmes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-10-30 20:06:39","2025-10-17 00:20:30","2025-10-30 20:06:39","55-81","","2","74","","","de Groot (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121362576","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121362576","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the county panel data from 2010 to 2019, a case study was conducted in Yunnan Province, a typical poverty-stricken area in China, to examine the impact of targeted poverty alleviation policy on urban-rural income gap in national poverty-stricken counties by means of propensity score matching-difference-in-differences method (PSM-DID). The results show that: (1) The targeted poverty alleviation policy is beneficial to the increase of income of the farmers in the national poverty-stricken counties, and can reduce the relative income gap between urban and rural areas. But it has no obvious impact on the absolute income gap between urban and rural areas. Other things being equal, the per capita income growth rate of farmers in poor counties at the national level rose by 0.1512 on average, while the relative income gap between urban and rural areas decreased by 0.3668 on average, but this kind of policy effect exhibits certain volatility, and the cumulative policy effect is not clear. (2) The targeted poverty alleviation policy has promoted the reduction of the urban-rural income gap in the poor counties by promoting urbanization, increasing capital input, raising the level of agricultural output, and adjusting the non-agricultural industrial structure. In the long run, while increasing the level of agricultural output, the gradual promotion of non-agricultural industrial adjustment will bring about a continuous cumulative effect on the income increase of farmers in poor areas and a positive impact on the improvement of income distribution between urban and rural areas. In view of the above conclusion, corresponding policy recommendations were further made. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2021","2025-10-30 20:06:39","2025-10-17 00:20:30","2025-10-30 20:06:39","1549-1561","","8","43","","","Zhang (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121362321","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121362321","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study aims to examine the change in deprivation rate among children aged 0–17 years between 2010 and 2012, as well as the impact of cash transfer on multidimensional child poverty in Ghana using the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). Design/methodology/approach: The study used the Ghana Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty Impact Evaluation Survey data, which has the baseline data collected in 2010, and the follow-up was collected in 2012. The authors used the difference-in-difference estimation technique to assess the impact of the cash transfer program on the MPI of pre-school (0–5 years) and school-aged (5–17 years) children, and compared the results with that of Propensity Score Matching. Findings: The deprivation trend reveals that deprivation among pre-school children increased for nutrition, water and sanitation. The estimated result shows that cash transfer significantly reduces MPI of pre-school and school-aged in beneficiary households by 10.5 and 1.3% relative to non-beneficiary children, respectively. Originality/value: For cash transfer programs to efficiently alleviate child poverty in Ghana, the paper recommends that the conditionality aspect of the program that has been neglected by managers of the program should be enforced.

The results show that based on counterfactual assumptions, if non- relocated farmers participate in poverty alleviation relocation, their total household income would increase by 2.56% . Poverty alleviation relocation effectively increased total household income of farmers, and the income growth showed obvious non-agricultural employment-driven characteristics. The contribution rate of relocation to reducing the income gaps was 1.56% . Low- income farmers had a higher degree of non- agricultural transformation and greater income growth. Compared with expanding the agricultural income gap, participating in relocation contributed more to narrowing the non- agricultural income gap, which was the main path to reduce income gaps.

Victory is simple，but persistence is difficult. The sustaining of achievements of poverty alleviation face challenges，and poverty caused by disasters is one of the key content that needs to be paid attention to. Therefore，exploring the relationship between agricultural insurance and farmers’poverty vulnerability is the practical need to improve China’s poverty alleviation policy system in the post poverty alleviation era. Based on the survey data of farmers in five provincial-level regions from 2019 to 2020，this paper studies the impact of agricultural insurance participation and security level on farmers’poverty vulnerability by using PSM-DID and THRESHOLD models. The research results in this paper are as follows. First，the security level is the key factor for whether agricultural insurance can effectively reduce poverty，only when the security level is beyond the failure interval can participating in agricultural insurance significantly reduce farmers’poverty vulnerability，and will the failure range of security level expand with the improvement of poverty standard line. Second，agricultural insurance can alleviate farmers’poverty vulnerability by promoting agricultural income growth，reducing income fluctuation and improving consumption level. Finally，through the heterogeneity study of poverty relief households，poverty-stricken households，persistent poor households and persistent non poor households，it is found that the poorer the farmers are，the smaller the critical value of the security level required for agricultural insurance to play a significant poverty reduction effect. Compared with the previous literature，this paper may have the following marginal contributions. First，this paper brings the security level into the analysis framework，verifies and measures the existence and scope of the failure interval of the security level in the poverty reduction effect of agricultural insurance，and provides a consistent explanation for the existing differences from the perspective of security level. Second，this paper verifies the mechanism framework including four action paths，namely，income level，consumption level，income fluctuation and consumption fluctuation. On this basis，combined with the characteristics of the role of agricultural insurance，the chain intermediary effect has further improved the action path of agricultural income （decomposed into technology input，labor input and labor productivity） and income fluctuation （decomposed into compensation income and loan acquisition），and enriched the framework system of poverty vulnerability impact mechanism. Third，this paper uses two periods of data to dynamically expand the poverty status based on the definition of poverty vulnerability，and examines the heterogeneous impact of agricultural insurance on the poverty vulnerability of poverty relief households，poverty-stricken households，persistent poor households and persistent non poor households. The research of this paper aims to provide theoretical basis and policy support for bringing agricultural insurance into China’s poverty alleviation policy framework. From the results of this paper，the government should take the improvement of security level as the main goal of agricultural insurance policy reform. On this basis，it should further explore how to strengthen farmers’active acceptance of and investment in agricultural technology with the help of agricultural insurance，connect modern agriculture and prevention of poverty reoccurrence from the endogenous power level. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2022","2025-10-30 20:06:39","2025-10-30 20:07:50","2025-10-30 20:06:39","24-35","","2","44","","","Ren (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121361106","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121361106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ensuring the sustainable upliftment of impoverished households remains the focal point of China's progress toward common prosperity. Consequently, a pertinent question arises: can impoverished families stably escape poverty after transitioning away from the support provided by Targeted Poverty Alleviation policies? Despite a few of related studies on this matter which yield inconclusive findings, further research on this issue can serve two fundamental purposes. First, it can offer a comprehensive evaluation of the implementation of Targeted Poverty Alleviation policies from a new perspective. Second, it can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects and mechanisms of such policies, enabling the formulation of sustainable poverty eradication policies during the transition period from poverty alleviation to rural revitalization in China. Ultimately, this research endeavors to contribute to China's gradual realization of shared prosperity. This paper employs the difference-in-differences (DID) method, utilizing balanced panel data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) of Peking University from 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. By incorporating Targeted Poverty Alleviation policies as policy shocks within the analytical framework, the paper examines the impact of these policies on the vulnerability of impoverished households, tests their long-term effectiveness in reducing poverty, and elucidates the specific mechanisms underlying these long-term effects. The findings of this study are as follows: first, the Targeted Poverty Alleviation policy significantly reduces the vulnerability to poverty of impoverished households by 9.8%, thus validating its long-term impact on poverty reduction. Second, the policy's long-term effect on poverty reduction is more pronounced among households experiencing higher vulnerability to poverty due to old age, lack of education, health issues, and other factors. This achievement effectively aligns with the policy's objective of concentrating efforts on combating deep poverty. Third, the analysis of mechanisms reveals that the Targeted Poverty Alleviation policy (1) facilitates positive income distribution, thereby creating a favorable social environment for the development of impoverished families, (2) provides financial support, granting conducive conditions for their advancement, and (3) fosters an elevated sense of determination, encouraging impoverished families to make development decisions that facilitate poverty alleviation and prosperity. Consequently, the policy serves as a crucial long-term catalyst for poverty reduction. This paper presents three notable innovations compared to existing literature. First, it comprehensively analyzes the income distribution effect, financial support effect, and ""will-raising"" effect of Targeted Poverty Alleviation policies on the path to stable poverty alleviation for impoverished households. This analysis, based on a comprehensive consideration of the macro and micro environments faced by impoverished families, expands upon existing theoretical perspectives. Second, the paper introduces poverty vulnerability indicators to evaluate the long-term effects of poverty reduction, specifically examining whether Targeted Poverty Alleviation policies can mitigate vulnerability to poverty among rural impoverished households. This approach partly addresses the research limitations observed in previous literature. Third, while empirical studies on the long-term effects of poverty reduction policies have yielded inconsistent conclusions, this paper utilizes nationally representative rural household panel data and employs the DID method to empirically assess the effects of policies on the vulnerability to poverty among impoverished households. Consequently, this study enriches the empirical research in this domain. To a certain extent, this paper unveils the inner mecha isms through which China's Targeted Poverty Alleviation policies exert long-term effects on poverty reduction. These insights are valuable for China as it formulates poverty alleviation policies in the context of the new era, enabling policymakers to prioritize the longterm efficacy of these policies. By providing an enabling developmental environment and favorable conditions, raising the aspirations of impoverished individuals to overcome poverty and achieve self-sufficiency, the risk of their relapse into poverty or entrapment in the poverty cycle can be minimized. Ultimately, this approach aims to achieve stable poverty alleviation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:37","2025-10-17 00:20:29","2025-10-30 20:06:37","97-110","","4","45","","","Huang (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121359186","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121359186","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effectively capturing and advancing the practical experience and historical significance of Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) through comprehensive and in-depth evaluation research is a crucial endeavor in the field of policy evaluation. However, the retrospective analysis indicates a lack of comprehensiveness in existing research on T P A policy. Prevailing studies predominantly focus on the ""explicit value"" aspect of the effects, such as the economic growth in poverty-stricken counties and the income rise in affected households一essentially the “explicit value"" part. Considering the fact that T P A as a national project with substantial investments, it is imperative to expand the evaluation scope to encompass the indirect effects, delving into the realm of “unseen effects"". This necessitates a departure from the narrow perspective of solely concentrating on policy groups. To fully identify the “hidden value"" and provide a thorough overview of the enormous impact that T P A policy has had on China' s rural development, A broader examination is required to uncover the potential “hidden value"" and comprehensively outline the profound significance that T P A policy has brought to China's rural development. Furthermore, such understanding can effectively propel the rural revitalization strategy and support China' s rural poverty governance strategy. This article departs from the conventional perspective of focusing only on the “explicit value"" of T P A policy effects and scrutinizes the potential “implicit value"" from a broader perspective. Empirically, the floating population outside the set of impoverished households and their neighboring non-impoverished households is included in the perspective. An income effect evaluation is conducted utilizing the difference-in-differences method (DID) with data from the China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS). This study also capitalizes on the unique spatial characteristics of the floating population, exploring its research value by connecting the “dual space"" of outflow and inflow areas, which is rarely explored element in prior research. The results indicate that the T P A policy has a significant positive income spillover effect on the outflow population and generating an estimated average of 79. 2 billion Yuan in “unseen"" benefits annually for this group of population. Group heterogeneity reveals a “Matthew effect"", with high-income floating populations experiencing a notably higher spillover effect than their low-income counterparts. The western group exhibits the smallest amount of income spillover effect when it comes to spatial heterogeneity in inflow places. Conversely, spatial heterogeneity in outflow places shows significant spillover effects for individuals with rural hometowns, while urban areas displaying negligible effects. The mechanism analysis underscores the role of peer effects, inter-regional cooperation, and enhanced public services in facilitating spillover effects. Following T P A implementation, it is articulated with comprehensive rural vitalization. The historical practice of T P A constitutes the historical experience of rural vitalization and T P A constituting the essence of rural revitalization experience. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation and summary of TPA's historical experience is imperative while scrutinizing the Chinese government's commitment to eradicating absolute poverty. This involves not only a meticulous evaluation of direct policy effects but also an effective assessment of “externalities"" or spillover effects, to uncovering the potential “hidden value"". These conclusions provide different evidences and inspirations for effectively inheriting TPA's strategies for the governance in the context of rural revitalization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-10-30 20:06:37","2025-10-17 00:20:29","2025-10-30 20:06:37","60-73","","1","46","","","Zeng (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121357697","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121357697","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the empirical evidence on the impact of participation in the program on the welfare of participants is limited. Hence, this study was designed to estimate the impact of the program on the welfare of youths in Southwestern Nigeria using the logit model and propensity score matching. A multistage sampling technique was used to randomly select 316 beneficiaries and 656 non-beneficiaries across 2 states (Oyo State and Lagos State). Findings from the analyses indicated that age, ethnicity, years of education, and being a member of a social group positively increased the probability of participation in the program. The impact of participation on the monthly per capita expenditure was estimated to increase by N6,946.47 for the beneficiaries and it reduced the poverty status by 46.8 percent. Therefore, participation in the scheme has a positive impact on the welfare of youth beneficiaries.

The study was conducted in the Wolaita zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR). The article measured the resilience levels of Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) beneficiary households against non-beneficiaries as a control group using Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis (RIMA). A random sample of 300 respondents were selected from the population of safety net beneficiary and non-beneficiary households in the study area each representing half of the sample. The study found that non-PSNP households have higher monthly per capita food expenditure than PSNP members, with a difference of 30%, indicating that they have better access to economic resources and opportunities. Additionally, non-PSNP households have higher resilience scores than PSNP members, with a difference of almost 0.1 point. The findings suggest that improving resilience through interventions such as asset-building, livelihood diversification, or social protection may have positive spillover effects on household food security and nutrition outcomes if targeted properly. The study also revealed important insights into the characteristics of households in the study area, including the prevalence of poverty and vulnerability, limited opportunities for non-farm employment, and high illiteracy rates, which have implications for policies aimed at reducing poverty and promoting sustainable livelihoods in rural areas of Ethiopia. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:37","2025-10-17 00:20:29","2025-10-30 20:06:37","","","2","9","","","Woldemichael (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121359884","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121359884","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By understanding this logical ground, this paper examines the effect of ISLM technologies adoption on household food security. The study relies on cross-sectional household-level data collected from 414 randomly selected household heads across three districts to analyze this issue. An Endogenous Switching Regression (ESR) model coupled with the Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) technique was applied to analyze the required data. The finding shows that the adoption of ISLM technologies has significantly increased food security. It specifically increases food consumption expenditure in households by ETB (national currency in Ethiopia; as of August 2021, 1 ETB is equal to approximately USD $0.02) 38.3 (27%) when compared to households that do not adopt groups. Similarly, it increases the adopter households’ dietary diversity by 14.5%. Furthermore, it plays a significant role in reducing the food gap period by one and a half months per year and the food insecurity access scale by 46% points in the north Gojjam sub-basin for those who adopted versus those who did not adopt. The policy implication is that the adoption of ISLM technologies can improve rural household food security and may be used as a means of reducing rural poverty. As a result, the adoption of ISLM technologies should have been promoted in the study area and elsewhere by inspiring land users by accessing external agricultural inputs at the right time and place to increase small-scale land productivity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:37","2025-10-17 00:20:29","2025-10-30 20:06:37","","","1","4","","","Ewunetu (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121358855","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121358855","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the data of China's e-commerce demonstration county pilots and newly registered enterprises from 2014 to 2020, this paper uses standard deviation ellipse, kernel density analysis and Markov chain to delineate the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of e- commerce demonstration county pilots and its entrepreneurial vitality. On this basis, taking Yunnan province as an example, the multi-period difference-in-differences model is used to empirically test the impact of e- commerce demonstration counties on local entrepreneurial vitality and its internal mechanism. The results show that: (1) The pilot distribution of e- commerce demonstration counties continues to expand, and the spatiotemporal evolution shows a shift from scattered distribution to a continuous agglomeration distribution relying on multiple cores, with the northwest and southwest regions gradually becoming the focus of policy coverage. Besides, the entrepreneurial vitality of the pilot areas shows an upward trend during the study period. The Matthew chain results show that there is a possibility of the level of entrepreneurial vitality of the pilot transferring to higher- level types, and has a significant Matthew effect. (2) The e-commerce demonstration county pilots significantly improve the local entrepreneurial vitality, and this conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness tests. The pilot policies reduce the restrictions of geographical factors and population size on entrepreneurial vitality, and have a more significant promoting effect on agricultural and finance industry, but their impact on manufacturing industry and technology service industry are not significant. (3) Mechanism analysis shows that the pilot policy improves the development level of traditional and digital finance, promotes agricultural modernization and accelerates infrastructure construction, thereby enhancing local entrepreneurial vitality. (4) Further from the perspective of common prosperity, the e- commerce demonstration county pilots are conducive to increasing farmers' income and narrowing the urban- rural income gap.

Open questions remain, however, about their implementation. We address these using data from debit card transactions, customer service call-line logs, and in-depth interviews from a randomized control study of a monthly unconditional cash gift delivered via debit card to mothers of young children living near the federal poverty line. Because much of the impact of the intervention occurs through mothers’ decisions about how to allocate the Baby's First Years (BFY) money, we argue that implementation science must recognize the role of policy targets in implementing policy, not just in terms of policy outcomes but also policy implementation processes. Further, our analysis shows that mothers experience key aspects of the cash intervention's design as intended: they viewed the cash gift as unconditional and knew the money was reliable and would continue monthly, receiving the correct amount with few incidents. Delivering funds via debit card worked well, offering mothers flexibility in purchasing. We also illuminate how design features shaped mothers’ experiences. First, although they knew it was unconditional, the social meaning of the BFY money to mothers—seen as “the baby's money”—shaped their engagement with and allocation of it. Second, low public visibility of mothers’ receipt of this money limited the financial demands or requests from others, potentially facilitating more agency over and a greater ability to use the money as they chose, without claims from kin. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-10-30 20:06:37","2025-10-17 00:20:29","2025-10-30 20:06:37","871-898","","3","43","","","Halpern-Meekin (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121357354","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121357354","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

China launched the Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program and implemented a series of anti-poverty initiatives, aiming to reduce poverty and enhance the well-being of rural households. The TPA program has been recognized as significantly promoting rural development, but whether it can benefit all poor households equally has been underexplored. This study systematically examines the impact of the TPA program on poor households with different causes of poverty and empirically analyzes income differences across household and village types under different income groups using a linear quantile mixed model (LQMM), based on survey data from a high-altitude deep-poverty county in southwest China. The results indicate an income imbalance among poor households with different causes of poverty, whereas households in poor and non-poor villages exhibit equivalent development. Differences are more pronounced at higher income quantiles, suggesting that the policy provides relatively uniform benefits to poorer households. Analysis of income sources reveals disparities between wage and transfer incomes, while benefits from business income remain consistent. These findings underscore the need for sustained policy support to enhance the stability and sustainability of poverty alleviation and income transformation among low-income households. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the TPA program, and the recommendations derived from the results can serve as references for poverty alleviation in rural areas of developing countries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-10-30 20:06:37","2025-10-16 23:14:05","2025-10-30 20:06:37","","","","","","","Yan (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121356066","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121356066","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its multidimensional impacts on rural development have not been fully investigated. We develop an analytical framework of the land consolidation-social ecological system (LC-SES). Drawing on remote sensing data and village-level panel data from 2014 to 2023, we employ a continuous difference-in-differences model and an event study method to examine the multidimensional impacts of LC. The results show that the average rural comprehensive development capacity (RCDC) of the study area has more than doubled over the past decade. Regression estimates suggest that each additional RMB 1 billion invested in LC projects is associated with an increase of about 12 percent in RCDC. Moreover, dynamic effects observed in the economic and ecological subsystems of LC project villages demonstrate a strong temporal synergy, suggesting that LC holds long-term potential for balancing production and ecological sustainability. Mechanism analysis reveals that farmland expansion, land transfer, and organizational governance are the primary pathways through which LC contributes to income growth among village collectives and rural households. Heterogeneity analysis further indicates that the effects of LC are more pronounced in poor, non-mountainous, and large-scale villages, highlighting its potential for poverty alleviation, ecological adaptability, and scale economies.

This study employs the establishment of these counties as a quasi-natural experiment. Utilizing county-level panel data from 2000 to 2021, we apply the Hodrick-Prescott (H-P) filter method to decompose economic output into trend and cyclical components. Subsequently, the Propensity Score Matching-Difference-in-Differences (PSM-DID) method is used to identify the causal effects of this designation on macroeconomic fluctuations and the efficacy of poverty alleviation. Results indicate that the targeted poverty alleviation policy exerts no significant impact on regional cyclical fluctuations but significantly amplifies the trend component associated with economic growth. Policy implementation elevated the trend component in the treatment group by approximately 9.5 % relative to the control group. This finding persists across diverse identification assumptions and robustness checks. Furthermore, the designation primarily influences macroeconomic fluctuations indirectly through industrial, financial, investment, transportation, and income channels. Heterogeneity analysis further reveals a less pronounced policy effect in eastern regions compared to central and western areas, a more substantial impact in ethnic minority regions compared to non-minority regions, and a more significant effect in high-density population areas relative to low-density areas. However, minimal variation in policy effect is observed across administrative divisions.

With higher poverty rates among households headed by women, providing affordable and reliable childcare is crucial to women's participation in the labor force, particularly in the formal sector, where returns and benefits are higher. In 1991, the Hogares Comunitarios Program (HCP) was established in Guatemala City as a government-sponsored pilot program to alleviate poverty by providing working parents with low-cost, high-quality childcare. Community-based day care programs similar to this have been popular throughout Latin America but have rarely undergone a rigorous evaluation. This study by researchers at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) was designed in collaboration with the Social Work Program of the Office of the First Lady of Guatemala and the Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama/Pan America Health Organization (INCAP/PAHO) and included an assessment of operational aspects and quality of service delivery, in addition to an evaluation of the program's impact on its beneficiaries. The specific objectives of the HCP are to facilitate the integrated development of young children of working parents and to provide and promote community participation in the overall development of children. Under the program, a group of parents selects a woman from the local community to care for up to 10 children, seven years old or younger, Monday to Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m, in her home. During their stay, children receive food (breakfast, lunch, and two snacks), care, affection, and hygiene and are involved in early childhood stimulation and socialization activities. The program provides the caretaker with basic furniture, equipment, educational materials, and supplies; initial training; and menus to guide food preparation. Caretakers also receive money to purchase food for the children, to purchase gas and educational supplies, and as compensation for their work. Parents are expected to complement this with a small monthly contribution and to provide monthly supplies of such basic items as sugar, toothpaste, and toilet paper. The operational evaluation reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the program's implementation, the quality of its services, and the perceived satisfaction of implementers and beneficiaries, including their suggestions for program improvements. To this end, structured observations, in-depth interviews, and focus-group discussions were conducted, as well as quantitative surveys comparing groups of participating and nonparticipating households, the latter using alternative childcare arrangements. The operational evaluation suggested that the HCP is a carefully designed, well-implemented program that is much appreciated by its users and implementers. Nevertheless, delays in receiving cash transfers for food, insufficient cash transfer amounts for food, and lack of parental participation were key operational constraints identified by the evaluation. Service provision in terms of hygiene, safety, and caretaker-child interactions was considered good overall but varied substantially across hogares. Caretakers consistently failed to allocate the required amount of time to educational activities, largely because of time constraints but also because they did not feel adequately trained, motivated, or remunerated. Caretakers were generally grateful to the program for the opportunity to work at home and look after their own children (or grandchildren). Beneficiary parents were very positive about the program, appreciating the caretakers' efforts, the support they received, and the program's affordability. Their suggestions included the addition of Saturday care and increased emphasis on preventive and curative health care. Most of the operational recommendations under this study were acc pted by the new administration, which took over the program in 2000. Concrete actions taken include increasing cash transfer amounts, strengthening the provision of health services, hiring educators to ease caretaker time constraints, and building human resource capacity through training. The program offers a number of potential benefits to its target population, including children's nutritional and developmental outcomes and school preparedness; economic benefits and improved employment opportunities for parents; and even increased educational attainment for older siblings, who no longer have to miss school to care for younger children. The main objective of the impact evaluation, however, was to assess the effect of the program on children's dietary and nutrient intakes. Other objectives were to assess the program's targeting by comparing selected characteristics of beneficiary mothers with those of working mothers using alternative childcare arrangements, and to characterize the types of alternative childcare available to poor urban dwellers in Guatemala City and compare their costs to those of the HCP. The study's impact evaluation found a significantly better diet at the place of care among children participating in the HCP compared to those using other childcare alternatives. Children in the HCP consumed on average 20 percent more energy, protein, and iron, and 50 percent more vitamin A than nonparticipants. Moreover, their weekend diets were also slightly more nutritious than those of nonbeneficiary children. This observation confirms that parents were not compensating for the program's benefits by reducing their children's food intake at home. Nevertheless, the program's long-term impact may be weakened because of extremely high turnover among participating children. Dietary improvement only translates to improved nutritional status when maintained for a period of three to six months or more. At the time of the evaluation, more than half the participating children had been in the program for less than one year, and one-third had participated for less than three months. The study also found that the program benefited two distinct groups of women. The first group, participating mothers, were young, often single, poorly educated, and living in precarious conditions. They were, however, significantly more likely to have formal employment (and thus access to social and medical benefits) and to earn higher average incomes than comparable mothers using alternative childcare arrangements. The second group of women comprised the caretakers, who were generally older and less educated, and had fewer opportunities to work outside the home. Hence, the program was reaching its target audience, and recipients were obtaining better and more stable jobs than otherwise would have been possible. It should be noted, however, that the program's coverage was very low. Despite offering one of the cheapest childcare programs in the area, only 3 percent of eligible households took advantage of the HCP. Although a significant proportion of non-users preferred that their children be taken care of by family members, close to half of the working mothers interviewed expressed interest in the program but were precluded from participating due to lack of available space. The positive overall assessment of Guatemala's HCP attests to the value of such programs in providing high-quality, affordable childcare, while enabling poor working parents, especially single mothers, to pursue stable urban employment. Although certain steps have already been taken to strengthen the program, expanded coverage and increased duration of participation per child would offer considerable further potential toward reducing urban poverty, food insecurity, and child malnutrition.

Using an endogenous switching probit regression approach, in this study, we evaluated the impacts of youth participation in agribusiness programs (YIAPs) on poverty and vulnerability to poverty in Nigeria. Our findings revealed that some demographic and institutional factors significantly influence poverty and vulnerability to poverty among youth. The impact estimates indicate that participation in an agribusiness program has a significant positive effect on poverty reduction among youth. Moreover, there would have been about a 28% reduction in exposure to future poverty for non-participants had they participated in a YIAP. Our results suggest that intervention programs, such as YIAPs, that focus on skill acquisition and youth empowerment should be strengthened and scaled-up in order to improve youth welfare and subsequently reduce/eradicate poverty and vulnerability to poverty among youth.","2022","2025-10-30 20:06:33","2025-10-30 20:07:51","2025-10-30 20:06:33","1-14","","5","12","","","Bello (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121350831","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121350831","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"5XDT9NFQ","journalArticle","2022","Assima Amidou Zanello, Giacomo, Smale, Melinda","Articulating fertilizer subsidy effects on women's diet quality by food supply source in Mali","CABI Agriculture and Bioscience","","","10.1186/s43170-022-00085-8","https://cabiagbio.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s43170-022-00085-8","Background: Mali's fertilizer subsidy program aims to reduce food insecurity among the nation's predominantly rural people by jump-starting productivity gains of major crops. This paper contributes to sparse evidence regarding its effects. Methods: Theory predicts that agricultural productivity can affect diet quality directly through two channels. The production channel influences the availability of food for household consumption or sale. The income pathway, resulting from sales, leads to household food expenditure. We test this hypothesis by applying propensity score matching methods to farm household survey data collected from 2400 households in Mali in 2018. Results: We find that the overall effect of the fertilizer subsidy on women's dietary diversity is positive in the Niger Delta and negative on the Koutiala Plateau. Further examination by food supply source reveals no subsidy effects on the dietary diversity provided by on-farm production in either zone. The subsidy negatively influences dietary diversity of foods sourced as gifts in the Niger Delta. Subsidy effects on dietary diversity accessed through food purchases are strong and positive in the Niger Delta, but negative on the Koutiala Plateau. The Koutiala Plateau is found in the region of Sikasso, where rising incomes from cotton production, which is the major export crop of the region and of the nation, have been shown not to alleviate poverty and malnutrition (a dilemma known as the ""Sikasso Paradox""). Conclusion: Our approach reveals that additional income from increased yields stimulated by subsidized fertilizer can enable off-farm purchases of more nutritious food and thereby improve nutritional outcomes for women.","2022","2025-10-30 20:06:33","2025-10-30 20:07:52","2025-10-30 20:06:33","","","42","3","","","Assima (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121350320","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121350320","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Communities that were randomly assigned to the treatment group began receiving the BDH in 2004 and those randomly assigned to the comparison group began receiving benefits two years later. Families enrolled in the BDH received a monthly cash stipend ($15USD) representing an approximate 6-10% increase in household income. Participants analyzed in this study are children aged 12-35 months from treatment (n = 797) and comparison (n = 399) communities in rural and urban Ecuador. Main outcomes measured were language skills (the Fundación MacArthur Inventorio del Desarollo de Habilidades Comunicativas - Breve), height-for-age z-score, and hemoglobin concentration. Results indicate that in rural areas, being randomized to receive the BDH in very early childhood led to significantly better performance on the number of words a child was saying, and on the probability that the child was combining two or more words. There were no significant effects on language development for children in urban areas and there were no effects on height-for-age z-score or hemoglobin concentration in rural or urban areas. A limited number of potential pathways with respect to cognitive/language stimulation, health behaviors, and parenting quality were also explored. Findings indicate that compared to children in comparison areas, rural children in treatment areas were more likely to have received vitamin A or iron supplementation and have been bought a toy in the past six months. This study provides evidence for significant benefits of an unconditional cash transfer program for language development in very young children in rural areas. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","2011","2025-10-30 20:06:33","2025-10-16 23:14:05","2025-10-30 20:06:33","1437-1446","","9","72","","","Fernald (2011)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121350426","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121350426","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rural land consolidation (RLC) has achieved sustainable land use by combining with land system reform and policy innovation, thus RLC has become an important means to consolidate the achievements of poverty eradication in China. Under the sustainable livelihood approach, this study reveals the pathways to alleviate multidimensional relative poverty of different RLC models. Based on questionnaire data of rural households from poor areas of Guizhou and Hubei provinces in China, this study constructs a multidimensional poverty indices (MPI), including five dimensions of relative poverty measurement indicators (income, education, livelihood, housing, and employment) and the corresponding critical values, and measures the multidimensional relative poverty status of rural households as well as the change before and after RLC. In addition, the effects of multidimensional poverty reduction of different RLC models on poor households were investigated by the quasi-experimental PSM-DID method. The results show that different RLC models exhibit different poverty reduction effects. A comprehensive analysis of the multidimensional relative poverty indices demonstrates that public-private partnership (PPP) model of RLC can significantly alleviate poverty status of rural household, whereas the government-led model has no significant multidimensional poverty reduction effects. The investigation of each of five dimensions reveals that the PPP model has a significant poverty reduction effect on all the five dimensions (income, education, livelihood, housing, and employment), but the government-led model has a significant poverty reduction effect only on income dimension. Accordingly, this study proposes related policy recommendations, which provides Chinese experience for other developing countries to formulate RLC poverty alleviation strategies.","2022","2025-10-30 20:06:30","2025-10-30 20:08:14","2025-10-30 20:06:30","","","C","123","","","Wang (2022)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121347482","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121347482","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The IFAD9 impact evaluation initiative was launched to quantify the target and demonstrate improved accountability, development effectiveness and facilitate learning within the organisation. Specifically, 26 rigorous retrospective impact evaluations are being conducted employing quasi-experimental designs. This paper describes the IFAD9 impact evaluation initiative and illustrates the methodology currently being developed by the IFAD Statistics and Studies for Development Division to estimate the target. This methodology is currently being piloted through in-house econometric analyses, and consists of combining synthetic panels with quasi-experimental methods such as difference-in-difference matching estimators. Synthetic panels overcome the limitation of having to estimate poverty dynamics without real panel data and provide lower and upper bounds estimates of poverty dynamics and mobility.

Despite the promise and potential of cash transfers to empower women, the evidence supporting this outcome is mixed. In addition, there is little evidence from programs at scale in sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of the Government of Zambia's Child Grant Program, a poverty-targeted, unconditional transfer given to mothers or primary caregivers of young children aged zero to five. The quantitative component was a four-year longitudinal clustered-randomized control trial in three rural districts, and the qualitative component was a one-time data collection involving in-depth interviews with women and their partners stratified on marital status and program participation. Our study found that women in beneficiary households were making more sole or joint decisions (across five out of nine domains); however, impacts translated into relatively modest increases in the number of decision domains a woman is involved in, on average by 0.34 (or a 6% increase over a baseline mean of 5.3). Qualitatively, we found that changes in intrahousehold relationships were limited by entrenched gender norms, which indicate men as heads of household and primary decision makers. However, women's narratives showed the transfer increased financial empowerment as they were able to retain control over transfers for household investment and savings for emergencies. We highlight methodological challenges in using intrahousehold decision making as the primary indicator to measure empowerment. Results show potential for unconditional cash transfer programs to improve the financial and intrahousehold status of female beneficiaries, however it is likely additional design components are need for transformational change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2017","2025-10-30 20:06:28","2025-10-16 23:05:07","2025-10-30 20:06:28","55-72","","","95","","","Bonilla (2017)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121344276","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121344276","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on statistical surveys and satellite remote sensing data, we construct a staggered difference-in-difference model to empirically analyze the dual impact of poverty alleviation on the economic development and eco-environment of poverty-stricken areas. This study also examines viable pathways for economic development in poor areas in the context of ecological conservation. The results show that the poverty eradication campaign under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has significantly improved the rate of economic growth in poverty-stricken areas while also significantly improving the quality of the local eco-environment. Further analysis shows that ecological projects and ecological compensation make the greatest contribution to promoting the conversion of ecological resources into economic output in poverty-stricken areas. China's successful experience in green poverty alleviation can not only provide important policy enlightenment for the nation's continuation of its comprehensive revitalization drive in rural areas, but also provide new options for other developing countries to achieve their green take-off.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:28","2025-10-30 20:08:19","2025-10-30 20:06:28","98-128","","1","44","","","Yang (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121343801","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121343801","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, further evidence is required to confirm the effects of HPAP. Background: This study examines the effectiveness and mechanisms of action of HPAP using data from a special survey conducted in five Chinese prefectures in 2018-2019. Method: This study uses a three-step feasible generalised least-squares method to measure the farm households' vulnerability to poverty. Hierarchical linear regression and propensity score matching were employed to assess the poverty-reduction effects of HPAP. A mediating effects model was used to test how these policies alleviated poverty. Results: The mean vulnerability to poverty among farm households was 0.367, with 11.89% experiencing both poverty and vulnerability, particularly in areas of deep poverty. This study has found that HPAP significantly reduces poverty and is more effective in reducing the vulnerability of non-poor farm households than poor farm households. Additionally, the results suggest that improving human capital stock and reducing medical expenditure are the two pathways through which HPAP can alleviate farm households' vulnerability to poverty. Conclusion: This study suggests that the vulnerability to poverty perspective should be incorporated into poverty alleviation policy formulation. HPAP enhances differentiation and precision. Thus, a long-term mechanism of HPAP should be developed.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:28","2025-10-30 20:08:19","2025-10-30 20:06:28","","","2260142","16","","","Wei (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121342518","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121342518","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was carried out to assess the changes on agronomic practices, crop diversification and profitability, women empowerment, and food security and livelihood of non-saline areas' farmers after the ACIAR project intervention (both cash and kind) at the end-line period. A total of 240 farmers (i.e., 120 focal and 120 control) was investigated during 2020-2021 following stratified random sampling technique from Patuakhali, Barisal, Jhalokathi, and Barguna districts. The collected data were analyzed using a combination of descriptive statistics (sum, averages and percentages) and mathematical analyses (Simpson's index of cropping diversity, partial budget analysis, women's empowerment index, food group consumption frequency score and German correlation sensitive poverty index). The majority of the farmers were found to follow the cropping patterns of Fallow - Aman rice - Pulses, Boro rice - Aman rice - Fallow and Aus rice - Aman rice - Pulses. Pulses covered around 37.0 and 33.0 percent of the total cropped area of focal and control farmers, respectively. The average cropping diversity was at medium level for both categories of farmers. The revenue from pulses production was found much higher than rice farming for both focal and control farmers. The extent of women empowerment was increasedat the end-line period by 2.8 and 0.8 percent for focal and control farmers, respectively after adopting the project intervention. The study found focal farm households more food secure compared to control farm households at the end- line period. As a response to the project support, the livelihood of focal farm households improved more than control farm households at the end-line period based on poverty dimensions (71.0 and 65.2 percent, respectively). The study concludes that the project intervention resulted in enhanced crop diversification and farm enterprise profitability, women empowerment, and food security, and livelihood improvement through poverty reduction in the non-saline areas of Southern Bangladesh. The study recommends direct input provision by the government to motivate the farmers continuing pulse production over rice monocropping, and time-to-time monitoring for bringing efficiency in cropping system.","2021","2025-10-30 20:06:28","2025-10-30 20:08:20","2025-10-30 20:06:28","29-48","","2","42","","","Uddin (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121342301","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121342301","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use mixed methods to investigate the relationship between a psychosocial behaviour change approach-empowered worldview (EWV), and investment decisions in children wellbeing among smallholder farmers in Zambia. Three years after exposure to EWV, logistic regression model results suggest that exposure to EWV was associated with an increased probability of parents providing basic needs of children including school fees, clothes, and food. This probability increased with more trainings. Using a matched sample, the average treatment effect on the treated of EWV is positive and statistically significant. Qualitative results reveal EWV enhanced participant agency, spouses' propensity to work together and with others in the community, and aspirations for themselves and their children.

The China Clean Air Action (CCAA) has been shown to alleviate the health burden caused by air pollution. Although the link between environmental degradation and poverty have been increasingly recognized, there are few studies that systematically assess the impact of the CCAA on reducing multidimensional poverty and the role of respiratory diseases (RD) in this context. Methods: We utilized data from three waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study and estimated annual average particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure using a high-resolution (1 x 1 km) satellite-based model. A Difference-in-Differences approach was employed to account for potential confounders like time trends and regional variations. Additionally, a dual mediation model was applied to examine the relationships between CCAA, PM2.5 levels, and multidimensional poverty, focusing on the mediating roles of RD and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Results: After adjusting for confounders, from 2011 to 2015, the intervention group exhibited a significantly greater reduction in multidimensional poverty index (MPI) compared to the control group, with an average difference of -0.0206 points (95% confidence interval: -0.0318 to -0.0092). As long-term PM2.5 exposure declined, there was a significant reduction in multidimensional poverty, with notable improvements across its sub-dimensions, including health status, living standard, social participation, and income level. The dual mediation model revealed a complex interplay among CCAA, PM2.5, and MPI, with RD and PEF mediating 22.80% of the indirect effect. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that long-term PM2.5 exposure increases the risk of respiratory diseases and reduces lung function, exacerbating the multidimensional poverty burden among middle-aged and older adults. Thus, we recommend incorporating air quality indicators into poverty reduction standards and establishing a dynamic monitoring system.","2025","2025-10-30 20:06:28","2025-10-30 20:08:21","2025-10-30 20:06:28","","","2438","25","","","Zhu (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121343335","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121343335","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study applied random effects with instrumental variables to estimate the effect of PSNP membership. The results of the study indicate that, although PSNP membership improves household food consumption, it reduces the household dietary diversity score. Household food consumption and dietary diversity are also significantly influenced by sex, age, education status of household head, household size, livestock ownership, distance to the nearest market and participation in non-farm activities. The findings of this study suggest that PSNP membership should be reinforced by building household awareness of the benefits of consuming a variety of foods. In addition, PSNP membership should be designed to endow the households to accumulate essential assets, especially livestock.","2021","2025-10-30 20:06:27","2025-10-16 23:05:07","2025-10-30 20:06:27","283-296","","4","16","","","Feyisa (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121342253","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121342253","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that, first, the implementation of diversified ecological compensation has effectively alleviated the relative poverty of farmers in the ECR areas, which still holds after a series of robustness tests. Second, there are differences in the impact of different types of ecological compensation on the relative poverty of farmers. Among them, industrial project based ecological compensation has the most prominent alleviation effect on farmers' relative poverty, while technological based ecological compensation has no significant impact. The overall alleviation effect of ""hematopoietic"" ecological compensation on farmers' relative poverty is larger than that of ""transfusion"" ecological compensation. Third, heterogeneity analysis indicates that the alleviating effect of the implementation of diversified ecological compensation on the relative poverty of farmers in the ECR areas with lower economic development levels is much stronger, and that of farmers with higher ecological awareness level and with the household head being the older generation of farmers is more prominent.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:27","2025-10-30 20:08:22","2025-10-30 20:06:27","161-180","","6","","","","Liu (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121342223","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121342223","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the sample data from CFPS and CHFS, this paper empirically examines the bundling effect of rural Dibao program in different periods by employing the Fuzzy RD method, and conducts a policy simulation analysis. The results show that the welfare bundling effect of rural Dibao program is continuously strengthened during the sample period, and the special assistance entitled to Dibao recipients is much higher than that to other comparable low-income families, especially regarding the renovation of dilapidated houses and medical and education subsidies. Through further policy simulation, we find that by transferring the bundled assistance to other low-income families, the income gap within low-income people can be narrowed and the effectiveness of the social assistance system can be improved without increasing the fiscal burden. Therefore, this paper proposes to break the bundling effect of rural Dibao program, turn the welfare ""cliff"" into a ""gentle slope"", and improve the effect of social assistance.","2024","2025-10-30 20:06:27","2025-10-30 20:08:20","2025-10-30 20:06:27","22-41","","3","","","","Song (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121341623","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121341623","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its primary goal is to enhance understanding of individual and relational factors at the family level as mediators and specific mechanisms through which poverty reduction can impact child well-being. Methods: Cross-lagged autoregressive longitudinal mediation analyses tested the intervention effect on child mental health, examining maternal depression, maternal anxiety, harsh parenting, and child exposure to abuse as potential mediators. Longitudinal data were collected over the course of 24 months in a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted among 360 dyads (children aged 10-15 and their female caregivers) in Burkina Faso. Participants were randomized into a control arm, economic intervention using the Graduation approach (Treatment Arm 1), or a combination of economic strengthening and family coaching (Treatment Arm 2). Results: In Treatment Arm 1, maternal depression fully mediated the intervention effect on child's depression (B = -0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] from -0.26 to -0.003) and child's self-esteem (B = 0.05, 95% CI from 0.001-0.18). In Treatment Arm 2, violent parenting practices partially mediated the intervention effect on child's depression (B = -0.08, 95% CI from -0.29 to -0.01). Discussion: Our study underscores the importance of multifaceted interventions merging economic empowerment with family-focused child protection strategies. This approach fosters a supportive family environment, reducing children's vulnerability to mental health issues in resource-poor communities. It enriches our understanding of how parental economic and behavioral interventions impact child mental health outcomes.","2025","2025-10-30 20:06:27","2025-10-30 20:08:21","2025-10-30 20:06:27","415-428","","3","76","","","Karimli (2025)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121341621","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121341621","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reduce extreme poverty and create the foundation for a sustainable livelihood change, BRAC undertook a targeted programme since 2002 named, Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction/Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR/TUP). Background: To investigate the impact of the CFPR/TUP programme on food and energy consumption. Design: Two cross sectional surveys on food consumption were conducted, a pre-intervention survey in 2002 and a post-intervention survey in 2004 covering 180 intervention and 193 non-intervention households. Three days' recall method was administrated in both the survey rounds. Results: The baseline food consumption survey showed an inadequate food intake in all households, which did not differ between the two groups. At post-intervention, the quality and quantity of food intake improved significantly in the intervention households as compared to baseline. In this group, the consumption of various food items such as rice, pulse, vegetables, fish, fruit, milk and egg showed significant improvement (p<0.001), particularly, the level of fish consumption doubled in intervention households while in control households it remained almost unchanged (14 g/day to 27 g/day for intervention vs. 11 g/day to 13 g/day for control). Energy intake increased from 1750+-650 Kcal/day to 2138+-704 Kcal/day in intervention households (p<0.001), whereas no significant change was observed in control households. Percentages of energy from cereals decreased from 85% to 78% in intervention households (p<0.001) while it remained unchanged in control households. Conclusion: CFPR/TUP programme seems to have direct impact on ultra poor family's ability to significantly increase consumption of food and energy.","2007","2025-10-30 20:06:27","2025-10-30 20:08:22","2025-10-30 20:06:27","58-64","","supp 1","16","","","Farhana (2007)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121341270","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121341270","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An Empirical Household Level Investigation in Rural India","Savings and Development","","","","http://www.fgda.org","A large amount of money is spent by developing countries in designing and implementing poverty alleviation and reduction programmes. Many of these programmes have well defined objectives and sub-objectives--but the achievements are quite often uncertain. Most of the studies conducted to investigate the effectiveness of these programmes emphasize structural bottlenecks, asymmetric information, and rent seeking behaviour as hurdles preventing these programmes from reaching comprehensive benefits to their target households. This paper moves the investigation one step further and probes whether effective governance or its absence has any effect on the effectiveness of the poverty reduction programmes. The paper thus provides an analytical characterization of beneficiary households from both troubled and non-troubled Indian states and studies factors that were important in the beneficiaries realizing income benefits from the SITRA programme of the government of India.","2008","2025-10-30 20:06:26","2025-10-30 20:07:56","2025-10-30 20:06:26","321-52","","4","32","","","Banik (2008)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121338319","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121338319","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, greater inequality in land-holdings and less competition between the two major political parties generally lead to less provision of the poverty alleviation programs. Second, the disadvantaged groups were not necessarily likely to be the primary beneficiaries of the poverty alleviation programs. Third, our results based on the natural experiment approach suggest that decentralisation did not lead to wider household access to poverty alleviation programmes during the 1990s. Our results imply the possibility that the power and resources were captured by the local elite after decentralisation, that is, decentralization did not necessarily contribute to the improvement of the welfare of the socially disadvantaged groups.","2010","2025-10-30 20:06:26","2025-10-16 23:05:07","2025-10-30 20:06:26","pages","","","","","","Sato (2010)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121337850","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121337850","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"BUANDADJ","journalArticle","2012","Parajuli Dilip Acharya, Gayatri, Chaudhury, Nazmul, Thapa, Bishnu","Impact of social fund on the welfare of rural households: evidence from the Nepal poverty alleviation fund","","","","","","The Nepal Poverty Alleviation Fund is a World Bank supported community-driven development program. Its objective is to improve rural welfare, particularly for groups that have traditionally been excluded for reasons of gender, ethnicity, caste, and location. Since its launch in 2004, the Fund has covered the 40 poorest districts of the country, supported some 15,000 community organizations, and benefited more than 2.5 million people. This paper attempts to estimate the impact of this large-scale program using a randomized phase-in approach, in which certain localities are randomly selected for earlier intervention than others. Using two rounds of survey data and a difference-in-difference combined with instrumental variable estimation method, it finds statistically significant causal impact of the program on key welfare outcomes. The treatment-on-the-treated estimate on real per capita consumption is 19 percent growth. Other impacts include a 19 percentage points decline on incidence of food insecurity (defined as food sufficiency for six months or less) and a 15 percentage points increase in the school enrollment rate among 6-15 year-olds. Impacts (positive or negative) are yet to be detected on indicators associated with child malnutrition, social capital, and empowerment. The policy implications of these results should be of interest to the government and to development partners in determining what may be effective instruments to deliver services to marginalized communities in what remains a fragile and difficult political environment.","2012","2025-10-30 20:06:24","2025-10-16 23:05:07","2025-10-30 20:06:24","","","","","","","Parajuli (2012)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121336847","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121336847","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The program provided a conditional cash and land transfer to poor families to relocate to larger plots of farm land. The average treatment effect of the program is estimated using a difference-in-difference matching technique based on propensity score matching; qualitative information complement the analysis to ensure unobservable characteristics do not bias the findings. As expected, the results show a significant effect on landholdings and agricultural production, with land size increasing and maize production increasing by more than 100 kilograms relative to the control. However, the impacts on food security and asset holdings were mixed. Households that relocated great distances had systematically lower impacts than those households that stayed within their district of origin because they had to adapt to unfamiliar agro-ecological, cultural, and market environments. Impacts also varied across gender of the household head; female-headed beneficiary households increased their productive and consumption assets significantly, while male-headed households increased their asset holdings less so.","2009","2025-10-30 20:06:24","2025-10-30 20:07:56","2025-10-30 20:06:24","46-pp","","5093","","","","Datar (2009)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121335878","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121335878","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"HWUHE2FA","journalArticle","2014","Su Yu-hsuan","Essays on Household Behavior in Developing Economies","","","","","","This dissertation consists of three essays in development economics. I explore various household behaviors in developing economies, using India and Tanzania as examples. The first two chapters focus on urban slums to capture the inequality within cities and to evaluate the impact of an intervention during urbanization. The third chapter investigates the influence of an inheritance law reform on child labor. The first chapter, which is a joint work with Claus Portner, examines the differences in child health across rural, urban non-slum and slum areas. The developing world is rapidly becoming more and more urban, but our understanding of the differences between urban and rural areas is still limited, especially in the important area of child health and its determinants. Simple averages show clearly that child health in India is worst in rural areas and best in urban areas (with slums in between) but it is unclear exactly what accounts for these differences. We examine the determinants of these differences and to what extent the same mechanisms affect child health in different areas using the 2005-06 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) data from India. Once we control for environmental conditions and wealth status, the urban advantage in child health disappears and slum children fare substantially worse than their rural counterparts. We also examine the impact of maternal education on child health across rural, urban, and slum areas and find that the positive effect of mother's education on child health is significantly stronger in rural areas than in cities and almost entirely absent in slums. Potential explanations for these results, such as school quality and migration, are explored, but these are unlikely to fully explain the differences in health. The second chapter, which is a joint work with Aidan Coville, evaluates the impact of a slum upgrading project in Tanzania. Developing countries spend significant amounts of their budgets annually on slum upgrading activities, with the broad objectives of alleviating poverty, improving health and well-being and strengthening the social fabric within these communities in a holistic and integrated manner. Rigorous evidence on the impact of these programs is sparse. Isolating the causal impact of these interventions presents a challenge, since the outcomes of interest are often correlated with the site selection for upgrading, and randomized controlled trials are not usually feasible for practical implementation reasons. While rigorous research is beginning to emerge on the effects of slum upgrading on diarrhea, acute respiratory illness (ARI) and the crowding out of private investments, very little is known about the broader impacts of the upgrading process that serve to motivate these interventions in the first place. This paper evaluates the Community Infrastructure Upgrading Program (CIUP) financed by the World Bank with the aim of improving the lives of slum dwellers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania through targeted investments in community infrastructure such as roads, drainage systems and streetlights. We find that the CIUP interventions increased household sizes and decreased out-migration, halved diarrhea rates for children under 5, and increased female school enrollment rates, but did not have significant impacts on employment, business operations, income and expenditure, private investment or social cohesion. We review possible confounding factors that influence the reliability of these estimates and present the results in light of these methodological constraints. The third chapter examines the relationship between female autonomy and child labor in India. Many children in developing countries are engaged in various forms of child labor. It is important to understand the determinants of child labor and to evaluate its welfare implications. Intra-household bargaining has been considered an important factor in household decision-making for investment in children. This paper uses the Hindu Succession Act Amendment (HSAA) in India as a source of exogenous variation i woman's bargaining power and information from the 2005-06 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) to study the effect on child labor. I find that the increase in mothers' bargaining power is associated with a lower probability of child labor, and this negative impact is especially strong for teenage daughters. A daughter of 12 to 14 years old is less likely to be working by 30 percentage points and is less likely to do family work by 20.6 percentage points if her mother is exposed to the HSAA. The HSAA also shows differential impact on families with different sizes and wealth status.","2014","2025-10-30 20:06:24","2025-10-16 22:53:50","2025-10-30 20:06:24","","","","","","","Su (2014)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121335676","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121335676","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"RQPU854V","journalArticle","2013","Massey Catherine","A Century of Life, Labor, and Migration on the Last Frontier","","","","","","My dissertation examines three important questions about the political institutions that have shaped the course of economic development in the Pacific Northwest region. Specifically, I examine how immigration policy altered who migrated to frontier regions in the Pacific Northwest; how western settlement and institutions affected indigenous peoples; and how these indigenous groups ultimately perform relative to other racial groups in the contemporary U.S. economy. I examine these questions empirically in three papers that span the course of the 20th century using two new, hand-collected data sources. Estimation of the causal effect of current immigration restriction on the size and structure of migration flows is complicated by selection issues and by the fact that contemporary migration policies operate concurrently with other entry restrictions. In my first chapter, I examine the effect of immigration quotas on the skills of incoming migrants using the implementation of the quota, outlined by the Emergency Immigration Act of 1921, as a source of exogenous variation in migrant skill. The 1921 quota restricted entry to only three percent of each nationality resident in the U.S. as measured by the 1910 census. Unaffected migrants, such as Canadian-born or foreign-born Canadian citizens, are used to construct a control group against which to compare those affected by the quota. I collected newly transcribed, individual-level data collected from ship passenger lists that report occupation, birthplace, and place of last residence, which are necessary for measuring skill and constructing the control group. By studying migration quotas in the 1920s, a true before-and-after comparison of restricted and unrestricted migrants can be made. Difference-in-difference estimates indicate that the 1921 quota resulted in flows of higher-earning immigrants. The probability that a migrant was low skilled decreased by 21.8 percent and the probability that a migrant was medium skilled increased by 16.5 percent. Importantly, this measured increase in skill is not solely due to changes in the national-origins mix of migrants. Rather, over 70 percent of the change in skill resulting from the quota occurred from within-country changes in the quality of migrants. In my second chapter, I examine the role that livestock-distribution programs can have on standards of living in developing economies. I employ evidence from the federal reindeer program of 1891, which distributed reindeer to Native Alaskan households living on the Seward Peninsula. This program was intended to provide Native Alaskans with a dependable source of cash income and employment. I employ newly transcribed, household-level data, which recorded the living conditions, assets, income, and household composition of a sample of Native Alaskan villages in the late 1930s. Comparing across those households with and without reindeer herds, I find that reindeer were not a significant source of household income and did not have a great effect on the sanitary conditions of the home. However, I find that reindeer ownership was associated with greater asset accumulation and larger houses, which may have mitigated these households experience of the Great Depression. My findings suggest that livestock programs may improve the living standards of recipient families, but are not successful at providing families with greater cash income. In the third chapter, I examine differences in the economic success experienced by various North American indigenous groups over the past three decades. In the U.S. alone, there exists substantial variation in policies regarding the indigenous groups of Alaska, Hawaii and the contiguous U.S. My third chapter is the first paper to compare the relative economic success of Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Indians, and to examine how economic performance of these groups has evolved over time. I estimate and compare earnings differentials for Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians, Native Indians and other racial groups across three censuses. These differ ntials are then compared to those experienced by indigenous groups of Canada. These comparisons further our understanding of the relative economic welfare of North American indigenous groups, and how different political institutions affect the economic well-being of indigenous individuals. Although there are large native-white earning differentials for Native Indian, Alaskan, and Hawaiian men, respectively, the percentage of the earnings gap explained by observable characteristics increased substantially from 1990 to 2010. Furthermore, nearly the entire earnings gap in 2010 between men of indigenous origins and white men is explainable by observable characteristics. This finding is particularly important considering the unexplainable portion of the white/black earnings gap and the white/Hispanic earnings gap is nearly thirty percent and rising. Under strict assumptions, these results imply that discrimination of Native Americans has decreased over time in the U.S., while discrimination of other groups has increased.","2013","2025-10-30 20:06:24","2025-10-16 22:53:50","2025-10-30 20:06:24","","","","","","","Massey (2013)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121336130","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121336130","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The empirical analysis consists of an evaluation of the impacts of two policy interventions in Brazil: the Programa Nacional de Credito Fundiario (the Land Credit), a market-assisted land reform program, and Bolsa Familia (Bolsa), a conditional cash transfer program targeting poor households. The first chapter analyzes the Land Credit program using both a binary treatment analysis and a duration of treatment approach and finds that the program increases many agricultural assets, but fails to increase incomes. The following chapter extends this framework to develop a multiple asset poverty trap model focusing on both agricultural and human capital. This model explores the factors that trap households in poverty in order to determine which combinations of asset and cash transfers are required to assist certain households. Finally, the third chapter conducts a joint impact evaluation of the Land Credit and Bolsa Familia programs. While it is argued that these two programs may either complement each other or compete over scarce household resources, the empirical evidence suggests that households in both programs are currently more specialized in agriculture, but that they are jointly investing in agriculture and education and may have broader future opportunities.","2013","2025-10-30 20:06:24","2025-10-16 22:53:50","2025-10-30 20:06:24","","","","","","","Fitz (2013)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121335675","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121335675","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2ARMIXQ6","journalArticle","2015","Sengupta Nandana","Machine Learning Techniques in Applied Econometrics","","","","","","The main focus in econometrics is to provide an explanation of various observed outcomes. Structural econometricians obtain reliable estimates of parameters that describe an economic system to provide an understanding of the underlying processes that determine equilibrium outcomes. The estimation process is based on conditions implied by economic theory. On the other hand, the main focus in machine learning is to provide accurate predictions of the variables of interest. While these techniques are extremely powerful for forecasting, it can be very hard to interpret the underlying structure implied by them. As machine learning techniques become more popular and computers become capable of storing and processing large quantities of data, there have been some recent efforts to incorporate such techniques into structural econometric models. My research aims to extend this literature. Chapter 1: Regularization Paths in Generalized Method of Moments In the GMM framework, the objective function to be minimized is a weighted sum of squares of m moment conditions implied by economic theory. The derivative of the objective function with respect to the vector of parameters provides a system of k equations in k unknowns that is used to obtain parameter estimates. However if this matrix is nearly singular at the true parameter values, then the system of equations becomes highly unstable. This is analogous to the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression. In the linear regression framework the problem is addressed by regularization. However, due to the highly non-linear nature of the GMM objective function, techniques like ridge and spectral cut-off regularization are not readily generalizable to the GMM framework. In the first chapter (co-authored with Fallaw Sowell), we re-interpret regularization as a set of possible solutions that lie along a path between the unconstrained minimum of the objective function and a pre-defined prior. Using this interpretation, we propose algorithms for finding the 'regularized' parameter estimates. We use the notion of cross-validation in GMM. We also show via simulations that our method performs very well when the system of equations is unstable. We discuss how to extend the techniques in higher dimensions and as an empirical application we employ this method on the Consumption based Capital Asset Pricing Model. Chapter 2: Propensity Score Model Selection using Machine Learning Classifiers The basic issue in estimating the effect of a particular treatment using observational data is that the data suffers from selection bias. In other words those who receive treatment (the treatment group) are inherently different from those who don't (the control group). Heckman (in his seminal 1978 paper) shows that a naive estimate of the regression parameter on a treatment dummy suffers from an omitted variable bias. The problem arises because we only observe outcomes under a single state (either treatment or control)--thus we have to control for factors which simultaneously affect both outcome and selection into the treatment group. Rubin and Rosenbaum (1983) pioneered the work on causal inference in the statistics literature. They suggest a two-step estimation procedure. In the first step the probability that an individual belongs to the treatment group is estimated (Propensity Score of the individual). The second step involves using the Propensity Score for pre-processing the data before estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). The use of Inverse Propensity Score Weighting (IPW) is now ubiquitous in the Causal Inference literature, however the estimation of propensity scores remains an open question. While many authors use logistic regression because of its interpretability, others argue in favor of non-parametric methods. We propose the use of machine learning classifiers (like Naive Bayes, Regression Trees and Support Vector Machines) for obtaining propensity scores. We show via theoretical arguments and simulation studies why its useful to consider a variety of propensity score models in the first step. We compare propensity scores estimates obtained from Linear Probit model as well as from semi-parametric classifiers like Naive Bayes, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines. In particular we find that propensity score estimates with Minimum Covariate Imbalance perform very well in terms of Mean Squared Error of ATE estimates across all simulations. Chapter 3: Evaluating India's Safe Motherhood Scheme using Inverse Propensity Score Weighting Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) programs are becoming an increasingly popular policy tool in developing countries to incentivize certain behavior such as school enrollment, vaccination and health check ups amongst a targeted section of the population. The beneficiaries of CCTs are typically from poorer communities and the final aim of such programs is to help such communities get out of poverty. India's Safe Motherhood scheme or Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), launched in 2005, incentivizes eligible women to give birth in health care facilities. With more than 9 million beneficiaries, it is the world's largest CCT program in terms of the number of beneficiaries. We use estimation techniques developed in Chapter 2 (IPW using Minimum Covariate Imbalance criteria) to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme. In particular we estimate the ATE of receiving financial assistance via JSY on two health outcomes--number of stillbirths and infant mortality. We also estimate ATE on three behavioural outcomes--whether the mother had 3 or more ante-natal checkups, whether any post-natal check up was conducted within 2 weeks of delivery and the frequency of child check-ups within 10 days of delivery. We are not aware of any other paper that uses Propensity Score methods to evaluate JSY at the national level. Our results indicate that in certain geographical regions propensity scores obtained via machine learning techniques were picked leading to results that are qualitatively different from those obtained by the standard linear probit.","2015","2025-10-30 20:06:24","2025-10-16 22:53:50","2025-10-30 20:06:24","","","","","","","Sengupta (2015)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121335108","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121335108","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that the risk distribution of rural households lifted out of poverty returning to poverty shows an olive shaped pattern with large size in the middle and small size at both ends. The ""continuous poverty alleviation policies"" have the effect of preventing return to poverty, but different types of assistance methods have heterogeneous effects. Specifically, the development-oriented assistance measures can effectively prevent return to poverty, but this type of assistance has a stronger policy effect on the households at low risk of returning to poverty. In contrast, the bottom-up assistance measures only have a preventive effect on the households at high risk of returning to poverty. Mechanism analysis shows that the development oriented assistance methods can reduce the risk of poverty alleviation by providing non-agricultural employment opportunities and stimulating the enthusiasm of rural households lifted out of poverty to work, while the bottom-up assistance methods do not affect the risk of poverty alleviation for rural households through this path. Further analysis reveals that skill training can stimulate the anti-poverty effect of development-oriented assistance methods, and the withdrawal of bottom-up assistance methods will not have a significant impact on households with low risk of returning to poverty. The conclusions this paper provide empirical evidence for the optimization and adjustment by category of transitional assistance policies, and help improve the targeting mechanism of the ""continuous poverty alleviation policies"".","2024","2025-10-30 20:06:24","2025-10-30 20:07:56","2025-10-30 20:06:24","167-184","","5","","","","Lan (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121333905","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121333905","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results show that TPA boosted the per capita disposable income of Chinese rural residents by 9.4% and contributed to more than 30% reduction in the county-level URIG. The effect of TPA on narrowing the URIG had a gradient decrease from the east to the middle and west of China, and from mountains to hills and plains, and that in deeply poverty areas was 2.36 times that of the non-deeply areas.

This paper compares the behaviors and performances of most vulnerable, ultra-poor and risk-averse households, who have been granted cash transfers for livelihoods investment, with the behaviors and performance of credit recipients, who are relatively better-off and willing to take credit risks. Using data from the Ethiopian pilot program, we tested if freely provided cash is used less efficiently as the sunk cost hypothesis portrays. Our data revealed that credit recipients indeed perform better than grant recipients. However, when we control wealth and other household characteristics, grant-based investments perform better than credit-based livelihood investments. Grants were allocated more likely to the planned investment than credits and the performances of the former is higher than the latter, both with and without controlling the intensive knowledge supports provided to grant recipients. The result is consistent and robust across different estimation approaches. This implies that the sunk cost hypothesis is not an important disincentive in livelihood grants. We concluded that livelihood grant (asset transfer) not only helps to reach the excluded ultra-poor but also to improve the effectiveness and productivity of rural livelihood investments. We further explained the possible reason for the superiority of grant over loan and its implication on graduation and program costs.","2019","2025-10-30 20:06:23","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-30 20:06:23","320-29","","0","113","","","Tadesse (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121330220","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121330220","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Farmers were randomly allocated two types of productive assets (tool or fertilizer) or cash, with a choice to keep the productive asset (cash) or exchange it for cash (productive asset). Loss aversion was proxied with a separate experiment and was used to assess the importance of endowment effect theory to explain exchange asymmetries. Our study finds a significant exchange asymmetry and a greater exchange asymmetry for the more popular tool than for fertilizer. Loss aversion could explain a small but significant part of the exchange asymmetry in tools, but trade experience did not reduce the exchange asymmetry. The findings are relevant for whether to use targeted in-kind or cash transfers to stimulate technology adoption and enhance food security among poor rural households.

"72GB2I9S","journalArticle","2018","Parada Gomez Urquiza, Francisco Javier","Access to Modern Markets and the Impacts of Rural Road Rehabilitation","","","","","","One of the main barriers limiting farmers' integration into markets in developing countries is the inadequate coverage and quality of the rural road networks, which result in high transaction costs and exclusion from social and economic facilities. These high transaction costs constrain poor smallholder farmers in remote rural areas into a restricted set of opportunities and a narrow range of access to facilities and markets limiting their ability to sell their fresh produce directly to the public and generate additional income. The isolation of farmers from markets provides a significant explanation for the regional dimension of poverty and economic development. Just like long distances to schools lead to low school enrollment and long distances to health care facilities lead to higher mortality during child birth, farmers' isolation from markets drive up the fraction of the agricultural workforce that experiences difficulty in generating income and meeting basic needs. Improving the quality of rural roads reduces the cost of arranging transactions between spatially separate locations and can significantly affect agricultural market prices, consumption expenditures, and poverty levels. This dissertation takes advantage of the partial implementation of a rural road rehabilitation project in western Nicaragua to identify changes in market prices attributed to improving rural road quality and calculates the magnitude these price changes would represent of a typical rural household's basket of consumer goods. In 2005, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), a United States foreign aid agency, signed a $175 million compact with the Government of Nicaragua to help reduce transportation costs, improve access to markets, and raise incomes for farmers and rural businesses in western Nicaragua. After widespread irregularities during the November 2008 municipal elections, the MCC terminated a portion of the compact, reducing funding from $175 million to $113.5 million and cancelling the rehabilitation of rural roads that were not already under contract. A substantial improvement in road quality resulted from the MCC's rehabilitation of a secondary rural route connecting the communities of Poneloya and Las Penitas in the Pacific coast to the city of Leon. Meanwhile, the rehabilitation of the 8.3-mile road Santa ix Teresa-Las Brisas was cancelled and it remained in poor condition. Price and availability surveys regarding 53 goods were collected at grocery stores before and after the intervention both along the treated road, Leon-Poneloya-Las Penitas, and the untreated road, Santa Teresa-Las Brisas. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) rehabilitated the road from Leon to Poneloya and Las Penitas in Western Nicaragua, which provides a simple scenario for this study. Leon is the second largest city in Nicaragua. The fishing port of Poneloya and the coastal village of Las Penitas are both beach communities that are becoming popular tourist destinations. The road that connects these communities to Leon was substantially rehabilitated at a cost of $21 million. Before the project the road's 12.2-mile surface was paved but in a very poor condition, as indicated by a baseline International Roughness Index (IRI) of 12.0, which fell to 1.84 after the rehabilitation. The average running speed of vehicles was about 35 miles/hour resulting in increased operating costs and travel times. The rehabilitation of the road was performed on the existing route with no noticeable changes on its alignment and it helped strengthen pavement structures, minor and major drainage structures, sidewalks and shoulders, significantly improving the road's quality and reliability, including during severe weather. The rehabilitation of this rural road connecting an isolated coastal area to the city of Leon in western Nicaragua substantially improved the quality of the road's surface. As a result, a significant reduction in transportation costs and travel times was expected to improve rural households' access to modern urban markets. The degree to which he resulting impacts on market prices for locally-produced goods could effectively ameliorate poverty and income inequality in the coast as a consequence of the project will depend on the heterogeneous distribution of the road's benefits. In the area of influence of the rehabilitated road, where fishing is the main source of income and poverty is either high or severe, it was found that improving the road could have benefited the poorest households by lowering the average cost of a basic basket of goods and by allowing fresh fish caught in the coast to be sold in urban x markets. This dissertation is broadly motivated by how challenging it has been to prove empirically whether road improvements raise the incomes of poor households in developing countries. Taken together, these three essays address the issue of how a significant rural road rehabilitation might allow isolated rural households to be better connected to markets for their inputs and outputs, which should be reflected significantly on their income. In the first essay, a difference in difference in differences (DDD) estimation strategy measures the resulting changes in markups between Leon and the stores located along the treated road, which can be attributed more certainly to the road improvement if this same effect cannot also be found along the untreated road. The treatment effect is aggregated across goods according to the Nicaraguan government's definition of a six-member household's typical consumption basket. The results provide evidence that the rural road improvement narrowed the gap between urban and rural prices by lowering the prices of some manufactured goods (e.g. toothpaste) and raising the prices of locally produced goods (e.g. fresh fish caught in the coast). In particular, price changes that result from a better connection to markets benefited poor households by lowering the average cost of a basic basket of consumer goods by -1.69%. Fishers, who are likely to be among the extremely poor households, benefited from the price of fresh fish caught in the coast rising by 31.9%. Consumers in small and remote communities face higher prices and fewer varieties of consumer goods, which contribute to worse living standards. Intermediaries incur higher transportation costs when selling to remote cities, making prices higher in these markets. Due to limited transportation infrastructure, consumption opportunities in small and remote cities in developing countries are especially limited. The second essay provides a theoretical model where a reduction in transportation costs after a road improvement makes it easier and cheaper for products to be delivered to stores, but also makes stores compete for customers more strenuously. A road rehabilitation would have two different effects. On the one hand, the direct transportation cost effect, which makes it less expensive to deliver goods to stores. xi On the other hand, the competition effect, which unlocks consumers' access to new markets reducing stores' market power defined as their ability to price above marginal cost. These two effects would allow to explain, for example, why stores in the middle of the road, being in a less competitive environment, could be the ones with the highest ability to charge above their marginal cost when the road is rough. After the road was fixed, these stores in the middle of the road lose their market power as consumers located in small villages can now travel more easily to either Leon or Poneloya-Las Penitas and are no longer willing to purchase goods at high prices. Finally, the third essay explores how farmers would benefit, not only from a reduction in the transaction costs of purchasing inputs and selling outputs, but from a reduction in the uncertainty of these costs. The main challenge for the road sector in Nicaragua, as in many other developing countries, is to improve the quality of the existing roads rather than to increase the extension of its road network. The low quality of rural roads in Nicaragua is aggravated by heavy traffic, geographic conditions and the h gh frequency of floods. Heavy vehicles, such as trucks and other equipment used in agriculture, are harder on roads than cars. For example, a fully loaded tractor-trailer is 20 times heavier than a passenger car and its impact on the roadway is disproportionately larger. Roads in rural areas with wet and mountainous terrain face substantially higher costs of maintenance than those in flat and arid terrain and must be fixed frequently in order to be in fair condition. High rainfall accelerates the process of road deterioration, requiring frequent and more intensive maintenance interventions. If water is allowed to stand on the road surface after it rains, vehicles create potholes that eventually discourage rural households' participation in markets by affecting the cost of traveling and the safety of all road users.","2018","2025-10-30 20:06:20","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-30 20:06:20","","","","","","","Parada (2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121329675","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121329675","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large interdisciplinary literature points to the difficult path from decentralization to poverty reduction. For example, fiscal capacity--the ability to raise taxes locally--is deemed necessary for local public goods to be reliably provided. But in poor countries local fiscal capacity simply cannot be built unless there is an income base to tax, which, in turn, requires poverty to be eradicated. Using three separate data sets we find three distinct pieces of evidence about the program's impact. First, the program reduced poverty at the initial as well as subsequent stages. Second, we find evidence that investment into rural infrastructure can be pro-poor. Third, the program, which amounted to a mere 3% of the national budget, created substantial capital stock over the years in communes and villages and delivered large returns measured in poverty reduction. A message from this study is that when the choice and design of projects are informed by local knowledge and local representation, investment can reduce poverty.","2021","2025-10-30 20:06:20","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-30 20:06:20","","","0","146","","","Boret (2021)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328804","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121328804","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

China's Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program addresses this problem by assigning local government officials to individual impoverished households. These officials, referred to as poverty alleviation coordinators (PACs), are required to pay frequent home visits to the assigned households and to deploy policy resources for poverty reduction. The program is costly in terms of human resources because the officials also have regular duties in a variety of departments. We investigate the effects of the PAC system on poverty alleviation and explore the mechanisms of the effects. Based on the Chinese Poor Population Tracking Dataset and econometric analysis, we find that the households with a larger income increase are those whose PACs work in a department that has the type of resources needed by the household. This indicates that a good match between the resource and the need could enhance the effect of the TPA program.

Although an extensive literature has documented the effect of these programs on poverty, there is virtually no evidence on the productive effect of the infrastructure. This paper attempts to start filling this gap in the context of the Productive Safety Net Program--a large-scale public works program implemented in Ethiopia since 2005. Under the program, millions of beneficiaries received social transfers conditional on their participation in activities such as land improvements and soil and water conservation measures. We examine the value of these activities using a satellite-based indicator of agricultural productivity and (reweighted) difference-in-differences estimates. Results show that the program is associated with limited changes in agricultural productivity. The upper bound of the main estimate is equivalent to a 2.2% increase in agricultural yield. This contrasts with existing narratives and calls for more research on the productive effects of public works.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:20","2025-10-30 20:08:03","2025-10-30 20:06:20","265-90","","1","105","","","Gazeaud (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327843","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327843","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In India, evidence of the impact of the now ubiquitous women-only savings and credit self-help groups (SHGs) on household consumption and asset accumulation is inconclusive and based on small-scale interventions. Further, little is known about the sustainability of impacts at scale. We use panel data on close to 2500 households from five states in India to estimate the impact of SHG membership on household expenditure and asset ownership. Over four years, we find small but significant impacts of SHG membership on household expenditure and livestock ownership. Membership duration has a modest effect, suggesting that initial impacts may taper off as the program scales up, though small sample sizes limit our ability to draw inferences. Accompanying evidence on pathways is compelling; related work shows that SHG participation improves information, empowerment, and access to entitlements. While the direct impacts of SHG membership may not suffice to fill gaps in access to credit faced by the rural poor, impacts along these additional pathways could intensify the benefits of these groups.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:20","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-30 20:06:20","490-515","","4","59","","","Raghunathan (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327802","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327802","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"JZE7W826","journalArticle","2023","Montoya Castano; Alejandro","Three Essays in Development Economics: Applications to Agriculture, Education, and Expectations","","","","","","This dissertation presents three essays in development economics, each one of them for a different low- and middle-income country. Each chapter analyzes factors that could influence the demand or supply of labor and focuses on a setting with significant levels of inequality. The first chapter, conducted with my advisor Mary Arends-Kuenning, analyzes whether an intervention that targets the poorest households in Bangladesh has effects on parents' expectations about the occupations of their children. In this sense, we analyze potential long-run effects of this intervention on the labor supply and whether these effects reinforce traditional gender roles. The second chapter, developed with Thiago Arruda de Oliveira, switches to the analysis of labor demand, by exploring whether the rapid expansion of soybean production in the agricultural frontier in Brazil is linked to the creation of formal jobs. Because this area of analysis is characterized by significant income inequalities and a large informal sector, we seek to contribute to the literature about the socioeconomic effects attributed to this expansion. Finally, the third chapter analyzes students' ranking and their effects on different indicators that measure academic performance in a large public university in Colombia. Like the first chapter, the analysis is centered on the labor supply and introduces some elements from psychology. The chosen university is of particular importance, as it allows low-income students to have access to quality education at negligible costs. It also faces inefficiencies, as it has high rates of expulsion and students remain enrolled for longer than expected without receiving a diploma, which affects their transition to the labor market. The next paragraphs provide a detailed summary of each chapter. The first chapter analyzes the unintended effects of a randomized control trial in Bangladesh that targets the ultra-poor on the expectations that parents have about their children's. iii occupations. Because significant aspirational gaps exist between poor and wealthy households, as well as between boys and girls, this chapter analyzes whether a graduation-type program can reduce these gaps. As the intervention is a composite of different services including the transfer of a productive asset, training, coaching, and a monthly stipend, among others, this research explores some of the potential channels that could explain changes in expectations, namely substitution and wealth effects, and changes in the perception of education. Further, it analyzes whether higher expectations are linked to better educational outcomes. The results show that the intervention only seems to reduce the aspirational gaps for boys, whereas for girls the intervention could be reinforcing traditional gender roles. The results also point to the importance of the coaching component in these types of interventions. The second chapter explores causal effects of the soybean expansion in Brazil on formal jobs. Recent literature shows ambiguous socioeconomic effects of the expansion of soybean in Brazil. However, these studies are descriptive in general and fail to establish causality. Therefore, the estimated effects cannot be attributed only to the expansion. The adoption of soybeans is an endogenous process, which hinders the estimation of causal effects. This chapter estimates the causal effects of this expansion on formal employment at the municipal level. The novel empirical strategy relies on the use of Synthetic Control Matching and the definition of a control group composed by municipalities that do not produce soybeans but meet the geographical conditions to do so. Previous studies use as control group municipalities that are not well suited for agriculture. This analysis focuses only on the municipalities that comprise the Brazilian agricultural frontier. The results show that the expansion led to increases in formal jobs in agriculture but did not have any effects on other sectors. There are also significant heterogeneities among the municipalities iv regardi g the magnitude of the effects. Using tools from the regional economics literature, the estimations also point to possible economies of specialization in the region. The third chapter analyzes ranking effects in a large public university in Colombia on various college outcomes measured at different times. In particular, it focuses on three questions: first, whether students who were at the top of their classes in high school react in the same way as average (or bottom-ranked) students do when both experience low performance in the first semester of college; second, whether studying with higher performing peers translates into better academic outcomes, as shown by the tradeoff between studying with high performing peers and ranking effects; and third, whether students who receive an academic probation in the first semester of college perform differently than students with similar grades. The results show that changes in rankings do not seem to have any negative effect for students, as higher high school rankings are usually correlated with better educational outcomes, independent of students' performance in the first semester. This finding is in line with previous research about the long-lasting effects of students' rankings. Likewise, students enrolled with higher performing peers experience significant decreases in their performance. Receiving an academic probation does not translate into significantly better academic performance. The calculation of rankings and competitiveness of cohorts could provide useful tools for colleges to analyze which students might be at risk of low academic performance.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:16","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-30 20:06:16","","","","","","","Montoya (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327446","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327446","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigate the effects of the programme on the number of days worked by different types of vulnerable jobseekers who receive the related income transfer in 2019 and are subject to activation attempts by employment services. We use data from Tuscany, in many ways a typical Italian region. To draw causal claims, we adopt a difference-in-differences approach with multiple time periods and staggered treatment adoptions. Our findings suggest that the programme has very limited heterogeneous effects among different types of users but also that, all in all, it is rather employment-neutral, in the sense that it neither creates significant disincentives to work nor succeeds in creating sufficient employment opportunities to solve the problem of job insecurity. An anti-poverty strategy that does not feed further welfare dependency would require a qualitative leap forward in activation efforts by employment services.","2024","2025-10-30 20:06:16","2025-10-16 22:53:49","2025-10-30 20:06:16","649-81","","2","10","","","Maitino (2024)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327093","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121327093","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conduct a randomized controlled trial of one such program. Participants randomly assigned to intensive, holistic, wrap-around services have 10 percentage points higher employment rates after one year compared with a control group offered only help with an immediate need. Most of this effect appears to persist after programming ends. However, we find limited evidence that intensive, holistic services affect areas beyond employment, even when other areas of life are participants' primary goals.

Five years after the program's launch, we conducted a lab-in-the-field experiment to measure the distributional preferences of household heads. Combining quasi-random variation from program rules with administrative census and experimental data, we find both economic and behavioral consequences of the program: It increased household income by 50% 5 y later, increased consistency with utility maximization by household heads, and increased their efficiency preference while reducing selfishness and leaving equality preference unchanged. Our findings advance scientific understanding of social preferences formation and highlight a broad perspective in evaluating poverty reduction interventions.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:16","2025-10-30 20:08:07","2025-10-30 20:06:16","1-11","","10","120","","","Li (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121326847","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121326847","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Standard psychotherapeutic approaches may be helpful, but low treatment uptake, low retention, and transient treatment effects reduce the benefit of therapy. This pilot randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness and feasibility of an integrated depression treatment/economic strengthening intervention. The study took place in two villages in the Sirajganj district in rural Bangladesh. Forty-eight low-income women with depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score >= 10) were recruited and randomized to intervention or control arms. The intervention included a six-month group-based, fortnightly depression management and financial literacy intervention, which was followed by a cash-transfer of $186 (equivalent to the cost of two goats) at 12 months' follow-up. The cash transfer could be used to purchase a productive asset (e.g., agricultural animals). The control arm received no intervention. Findings showed significant reduction in depression scores in the intervention group. The mean PHQ-9 score decreased from 14.5 to 5.5 (B +- SE, -9.2 +- 0.8 95% CI -10.9, -7.5, p < 0.01) compared to no change in the control group. Most other psycho-social outcomes, including tension, self-esteem, hope, social-support, and participation in household economic decision-making, also improved with intervention. An integrated depression treatment and financial empowerment intervention was found to be highly effective among rural low-income women with depression.

Most studies fail to distinguish between these two. Thus, we know little about which effects dominate and their long-term welfare implications. Using a random distribution of discount coupons and drought events that trigger payouts as exogenous variations, this study aims to identify both the ex ante risk-management and ex post payout effects of index insurance in a pastoral-dominant society of northern Kenya, where the presence of asset-based poverty traps, represented by bifurcated herd-size dynamics, has been established in the literature. We find the following: (1) Both risk-management and payout effects contribute to reducing the probability of distress sales of livestock; (2) payout effects also lead to a reduced slaughter of livestock; (3) while payout effects remain robust in a subsample of poorer households below the poverty trap threshold, risk-management effects do not. Overall, our results suggest that insurance payouts assist people in escaping from poverty traps more effectively than do behavioural changes accompanied by insurance purchases.","2019","2025-10-30 20:06:16","2025-10-30 20:08:09","2025-10-30 20:06:16","32-pp","","19/07","","","","Noritomo (2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121325730","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121325730","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting: A large childrens' hospital serving the urban poor in Kolkata, India. Subjects: Children aged 2-35 months admitted with severe ALRI. Intervention: In total, 174 children were randomly assigned to receive alpha -tocopherol 200 mg and ascorbic acid 100 mg twice daily or placebo for 5 days. All children received standard treatment for severe ALRI. Outcome measures were: time taken to recover from a very ill status, fever, tachypnoea, and feeding difficulty; and improvement in oxidative stress and immune response indicated by thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) and response to skin antigens, respectively. Results: Recovery rate ratios (95% CI) using proportional hazards model were 0.89 (0.64-1.25), 1.01 (0.72-1.41), 0.86 (0.57-1.29), and 1.12 (0.77-1.64) for very ill status, feeding difficulty, fever, and tachypnoea, respectively. TBARS values were high and similar in the two groups at admission, discharge, and at 2 weeks follow-up. Serum alpha -tocopherol significantly increased in treated group at discharge. Immune response to skin antigens were very poor at admission and after 2 weeks, in both groups. Conclusion: Infants with severe ALRI failed to benefit from two antioxidant nutrients as adjunct therapy. Severe ALRI in infants may cause cell-mediated immune dysfunction.

Enrolment in participating districts reached 50%, holding promise to achieve the goal of Universal Health Coverage in the country. Despite the government's efforts to expand community-based health insurance to all districts, evidence is lacking on how enrolment in the programme nudges health seeking behaviour among the most vulnerable rural households. This study aims to examine the effect of community-based health insurance enrolment among the most vulnerable and extremely poor households participating in Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme on the utilisation of healthcare services in the Amhara region. Methods: Data for this study came from Amhara pilot integrated safety net programme baseline survey in Ethiopia and were collected between December 2018 and February 2019 from 5,398 households. We used propensity score matching method to estimate the impacts of enrolment in community-based health insurance on outpatient, maternal, and child preventive and curative healthcare services utilisation. Results: Results show that membership in community-based health insurance increases the probabilities of visiting health facilities for curative care in the past month by 8.2 percentage points (95% CI 5.3 to 11.1), seeking care from a health professional by 8.4 percentage points (95% CI 5.5 to 11.3), and visiting a health facility to seek any medical assistance for illness and check-ups in the past 12 months by 13.9 percentage points (95% CI 10.5 to 17.4). Insurance also increases the annual household per capita health facility visits by 0.84 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.04). However, we find no significant effects of community-based health insurance membership on utilisation of maternal and child healthcare services. Conclusion: Findings that community-based health insurance increased outpatient services utilisation implies that it could also contribute towards universal health coverage and health equity in rural and informal sectors. The absence of significant effects on maternal and child healthcare services may be due to the free availability of such services for everyone at the public health facilities, regardless of insurance membership. Outpatient services use among insured households is still not universal, and understanding of the barriers to use, including supply-side constraints, will help improve universal health coverage.","2023","2025-10-30 20:06:13","2025-10-30 20:08:08","2025-10-30 20:06:13","","","55","23","","","Mussa (2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121319968","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121319968","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It develops a simple theoretical model, which uses child labor, training, and schooling to maximize household income over time, subject to resource constraints. Then, it conducts an empirical analysis using randomized trial data, which were collected for the evaluation of the 2006 Nicaragua conditional cash transfer program. This social program transfers wealth to poor families in rural areas, conditional on children's school attendance and health check-ups. In addition, for one third of the beneficiaries, there is a further wealth transfer to start a non-agricultural business. The paper finds that the conditional cash transfer program affected the volume and quality of child labor, reducing it in the aggregate and steering it towards skill-forming activities. Specifically, the program appears to have reduced the use of child labor for household chores and farm work, while increasing it for the non-traditional, skill-forming activities related to commerce and retail. Moreover, the paper finds that the source behind the increase in skill-forming child labor is not the basic component, which provides a transfer for paying for schooling and health services, but it's the business-grant component, which provides a household grant for the creation of a micro business or a new economic activity.","2012","2025-10-30 20:06:13","2025-10-30 20:08:09","2025-10-30 20:06:13","39-pp","","5959","","","","Carpio (2012)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121319138","","","","","⛔ No DOI found; EPPI-Reviewer ID: 121319138","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An evaluation of two CBNRM interventions, the Tchuma Tchato Project in Mozambique and the Kwandu Conservancy in Namibia, measured the impacts at the household level using multidimensional poverty indices. The analysis found no positive impacts on the multiple dimensions of poverty arising from the Tchuma Tchato initiative in Mozambique. In Kwandu Conservancy in Namibia, positive impacts were felt only on household financial capital on a disappointingly narrow scale. These results have important implications for policy makers and program designers and demonstrate the necessity of developing targeted strategies if poverty alleviation outcomes are to be achieved.

We exploit features of LRAD program implementation to extract exogenous variation in whether, and for how long, applicant households enjoyed land transfers. Binary treatment estimates, which compare treated with untreated households, show that beneficiary households on average experienced a 25% increase in per-capita consumption. Our preferred continuous treatment estimates, which analyze only the subset of treated households, identify the impact time path of land transfers on consumption.

Specifically, the effects of this policy at the initial phase of execution through break-point regression; the impacts of this policy during the implementation period by using an instrumental variable panel regression; and comparative studies of the policy impacts by using the generalized synthetic control method. The outcomes showed that: (1) China's state policy for specific poverty mitigation has a substantial impact on reducing poverty, which has been observed from the start of the enactment, namely, peasants' net income per capita from 2011 to 2013 increased by 13.9%, as compared to that during 2008–2010. Meanwhile, the net earnings of each farmer grew by 22% from 2011 to 2015 throughout the implementation phase of the policy, as opposed to that in 1998–2010. (2) Economic behavior in the marketplace and agricultural output figure of impoverished regions has significantly improved farmers' individual net income. (3) The comparative study further proves that the poverty mitigation policy has the effect of reducing poverty. Based on these findings, it is proposed that China should increase investment to consolidate its poverty alleviation policy in the most poverty-stricken areas, activate rural markets and develop agricultural production at the local level to accelerate poverty reduction in the region. The method of causal inference was utilized as an innovative method to study China's focused poverty reduction policy for both immediate and permanent effects. It is the first time to use the generalized integrated control method, which is a causal inference frontier method, to further verify the effectiveness of poverty reduction policies.

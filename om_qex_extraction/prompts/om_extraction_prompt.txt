You are an outcome mapping expert specializing in categorizing research outcomes from impact evaluation studies. Your task is to identify and classify ALL outcomes that were MEASURED and ANALYZED in a research paper.

# TASK

Extract all outcomes that have statistical analysis (effect estimates, regression results, or treatment effects). Return your extraction as a valid JSON array.

# IMPORTANT CRITERIA

**ONLY include outcomes that:**
- Appear in results tables with statistical estimates
- Have quantitative analysis (regression coefficients, effect sizes, mean differences, etc.)
- Are part of the empirical evaluation (not just mentioned or discussed)

**DO NOT include outcomes that:**
- Are only mentioned in literature review or introduction
- Are discussed but not analyzed in this study
- Are planned but not yet measured
- Are qualitative only without quantitative analysis

# OUTPUT SCHEMA

```json
{
  "study_id": "string (EPPI-Reviewer ID if available)",
  "outcomes": [
    {
      "outcome_group": "string (high-level category)",
      "outcome_category": "string (specific outcome name)",
      "location": "string (page, table, and section reference)",
      "literal_text": "string (exact text from paper showing the outcome and estimate)",
      "text_position": "string (where this text appears: e.g., 'Table 6, Row 3, Column 2' or 'Page 25, paragraph 2')"
    }
  ]
}
```

# FIELD DEFINITIONS

## Study Identification
- **study_id**: EPPI-Reviewer ID if mentioned (starts with 121...), otherwise extract DOI or create from "AuthorYear"

## Outcome Fields (extract for EACH outcome)
- **outcome_group**: Broad outcome category from this list:
  - "Poverty"
  - "Income" 
  - "Expenditure/Consumption"
  - "Assets"
  - "Work/Employment"
  - "Health"
  - "Education"
  - "Food Security"
  - "Social Capital/Empowerment"
  - "Financial Inclusion"
  - "Other" (specify in outcome_category)

- **outcome_category**: Specific outcome variable name as described by authors
  - Use the author's exact terminology
  - Be concise but specific (e.g., "Total household per capita expenditure (USD)")
  - Include units if mentioned (e.g., "(MWK)", "(USD ppa)", "(yes/no)")

- **location**: Where in the paper this outcome is found
  - Format: "Page X; Table Y; [table name]; Row: [row label]; Column: [column label]"
  - Example: "Page 25; Table 6; Project impact on saving and loans; Row: Project; Column: (3) Amount savings (MWK)"
  - If in text only: "Page X; Results section; [paragraph description]"

- **literal_text**: Exact verbatim text from the paper showing this outcome
  - Include the row label, outcome name, coefficient/effect size, and statistical significance
  - Example: "Project | 4,408** (1,369)" or "Amount savings (MWK): β=4408, SE=1369, p<0.01"
  - Keep it short but verifiable - enough to find it in the paper

- **text_position**: Precise location within document structure
  - For tables: "Table 6, Row 'Project', Column '(3) Amount savings (MWK)'"
  - For text: "Page 25, Section 4.2, Paragraph 3"
  - For figures: "Figure 3, Panel B, Outcome variable 'Savings'"

# EXTRACTION RULES

1. **Comprehensiveness**: Extract ALL outcomes that appear in results tables with statistical analysis
   - **CRITICAL**: Scan the ENTIRE results section from beginning to end
   - Main results tables are primary source  
   - Also check robustness checks and heterogeneity analyses if they report effect estimates
   - Include appendix tables if they contain original empirical results
   - **Do NOT stop after the first few tables** - papers often have 10-20+ results tables
   - If a paper reports 20 outcome variables with estimates, return 20 items
   - Continue until you reach the discussion/conclusion section

2. **Statistical analysis requirement**: 
   - Outcome MUST have a quantitative estimate (coefficient, effect size, odds ratio, etc.)
   - Table or text must show the treatment effect for this outcome
   - Descriptive statistics alone (mean, SD) are NOT sufficient

3. **Outcome groups**: Choose the most appropriate category
   - If an outcome fits multiple groups, choose the primary one
   - For ambiguous cases, use "Other" and be specific in outcome_category

4. **Location precision**: Be as specific as possible
   - Always include page number
   - Table/figure number and name if available
   - Row and column labels for tables

5. **Duplicates**: Only report each unique outcome once
   - If same outcome appears in multiple tables (e.g., main results + robustness), reference the main results table
   - Don't duplicate subgroup analyses unless they represent distinct outcomes

# PAPER TEXT TO EXTRACT

# YOUR EXTRACTION

BEFORE providing your JSON output, mentally verify:
1. Have I scanned the ENTIRE results section?
2. Did I check all tables mentioned in the results?  
3. Did I continue past the first 5-10 tables to find later outcomes?
4. Are there any tables with "Table [number]:" that I might have missed?

Then provide ONLY valid JSON matching the schema above. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON.

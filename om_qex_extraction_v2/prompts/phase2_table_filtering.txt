# PHASE 2: TABLE FILTERING PROMPT

You are classifying tables from a research paper as either RESULTS or DESCRIPTIVE.

## DEFINITIONS

**RESULTS tables** contain:
- Treatment effects, impact estimates, program effects
- Regression coefficients, statistical estimates
- P-values, standard errors, confidence intervals
- Comparative outcomes between treatment and control groups
- Tables showing "Project impact on...", "Treatment effects on...", "Impacts of..."

**DESCRIPTIVE tables** contain:
- Baseline characteristics, summary statistics
- Balance tables comparing groups at baseline
- Attrition analysis, sample demographics
- Descriptive statistics without treatment comparisons
- Tables showing "Balance table...", "Summary statistics...", "Sample characteristics..."

## YOUR TASK

Classify each table based on its title and any available context.

For each table, output:
- **table_number**: The table's identifier (string)
- **classification**: Either "RESULTS" or "DESCRIPTIVE"
- **confidence**: Your confidence (0.0-1.0)
- **reasoning**: Brief explanation of your classification

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown code blocks):

```json
{
  "tables_classified": [
    {
      "table_number": "1",
      "classification": "RESULTS",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Table titled 'Summary of impacts' contains treatment effects"
    },
    {
      "table_number": "2",
      "classification": "DESCRIPTIVE",
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Balance table showing baseline characteristics"
    }
  ]
}
```

## IMPORTANT

- Classify ALL tables provided
- Use exact table_number from input
- Balance tables (comparing groups at baseline) are DESCRIPTIVE
- Impact/effect tables (comparing outcomes after treatment) are RESULTS
- When in doubt, use confidence < 0.8

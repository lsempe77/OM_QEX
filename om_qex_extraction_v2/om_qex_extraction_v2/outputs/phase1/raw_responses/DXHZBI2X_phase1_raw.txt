Based on my analysis of the TEI XML content, I found several tables mentioned in the paper. Here is my structured JSON response:

The paper contains 8 tables in total, with a sequential numbering from 1 to 8. Four tables appear as structured <figure type="table"> elements, while four others appear embedded in paragraphs. All tables have clear titles and are explicitly labeled as tables in the text. The numbering is consistent with no gaps. I found no tables that were only referenced without content being shown.

The tables cover topics including baseline characteristics, child labor measures, and various regression analyses examining the impact of the program on child labor. The tables appear to be integral to presenting the key empirical results of the study.

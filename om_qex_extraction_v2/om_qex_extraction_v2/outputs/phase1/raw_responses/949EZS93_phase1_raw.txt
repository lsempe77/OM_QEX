I've analyzed the TEI XML content and found several tables. Here is my structured JSON response:

  ],

    "text_references_only": 0
  }
}
```

The paper contains 7 tables, all properly structured within <figure type="table"> tags. The tables appear to be numbered sequentially from 1-7 with no gaps. All tables have clear titles and XML IDs. I did not find any paragraph-embedded tables or text-only table references that weren't associated with an actual table structure.

The tables cover topics like randomization tests, child labor measures, regression analyses, and transition statistics related to the paper's study of conditional cash transfers and child labor.
